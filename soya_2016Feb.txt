{"text": "Ah, tablets. If a tablet was one of the characters in my sappy rom-com, it\u2019d be the \u2018one that got away\u2019. To me, it was a novel idea where you could have your smartphone with you for the serious business stuff while your tablet showed you a good time between working hours \u2014 literally, with videos and movies or a good book \u2014 but when you actually think about it, the tablet simply isn\u2019t practical.If you take a look at the International Data Corporation\u2019s (IDC) latest report on their preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker, you\u2019ll find the truth in my words as tablet sales are on a downward trajectory. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all doom and gloom though as their report also says that detachable tablet sales have reached an all-time high \u2014 lead by the sales of none other than the .Spearheading the detachable (or convertible/2-in-1) pack to finish at 8.1 million devices sold in Q4 of 2015 is Apple\u2019s biggest iPad, the Pro, raking in just over 2 million units sold \u2014 more than Microsoft\u2019s entire  lineup put together. That\u2019s quite\u00a0surprising if you ask me because we think that the Surface, especially the  is a  that can easily replace your laptop, at least for productivity anyway.On the other hand, if you look at reviews online, the iPad Pro is nothing more than a ginormous  with a flimsy looking rubber keyboard that has the word \u201cSmart\u201d in its name. Uh oh, am I \u201cbashing\u201d Apple again? Oops.I guess I was wrong then\u00a0if we\u2019re going off sales figures because Microsoft only sold about 1.6 million Surface devices in the same quarter. That\u2019s a gigantic gap especially if you consider how many Surface devices there are on the market versus the lone iPad Pro. Quite a feat then but it\u2019s worth noting that this is only one quarter and we\u2019ll have to see if the iPad Pro can keep this up over the coming quarters.We can definitely see the appeal of a 2-in-1 because it brings the power of the laptop into the form-factor of a tablet. The emphasis is on power though as IDC\u2019s findings reveal that of the Surface devices sold, more of them are of the pricier and more powerful Surface Pro line, as opposed to a more affordable Surface 3.That said, Microsoft wasn\u2019t the biggest loser in the last quarter because that title belongs to Google. According to the IDC, Google\u2019s recent stab at staking a claim in the convertible market was rather lackluster and that it \u201cwill require a lot more refinement to achieve any measurable success\u201d.Oh dear. Google better get cracking on that  if they want to carve a slice out of this market.Rounding up the report though is the sad news of the \u201cslate\u201d tablet\u2019s slow demise as the entire tablet sales dropped 10.1%, from 230.1 million to 206.8 million devices. The way we see it, the problem with the slate tablet is that they\u2019re neither here nor there.Unless you\u2019re picking up one of Apple\u2019s iPads (they\u2019re leading the sales by the way at 16.1 million units shipped \u2014 7.1 million more than the second-placed\u00a0Samsung) which do offer some tablet optimisations, you\u2019re usually stuck with\u00a0either an unoptimised Android tablet or a buggy Windows tablet.Amazon\u2019s USD50 (around RM210) Fire tablet, which runs on their own Fire OS, did come in at a surprising third place \u2014 accounting for 7.9% of the market share, beating out the likes of Lenovo and Huawei. Though IDC does note that Amazon\u2019s success is purely based on the price of its tablet.Trying times for the tablet industry it seems, though, there is some hope in the convertible market, it looks like the slate tablet is slowly dying off.[, ]", "id": "2"},
{"text": "As the telco war rages on,  has\u00a0revised their  plan in a bid to make their plans more competitive. This new FIRST Gold plan offers users 10GB of mobile Internet + 5GB of WiFi and unlimited free calls and SMS for only RM80 a month.This new FIRST Gold plan is a bump up from the , offering users 10GB of mobile Internet that is split between 5GB of mobile data and 5GB of weekend data (1.25GB for every weekend) + 5GB of WiFi, compared to the existing plan\u2019s 8GB mobile Internet (4GB mobile data + 4GB weekend data) and 4GB of WiFi.Not only that\u00a0but the entire plan itself has received a price cut of RM20 working out to a theoretical RM5.33/GB of Internet. An emphasis on the theoretical part though because your Internet quota is split between three different types and even in the most ideal of situations it seems unlikely that you will be able to make full use of it all.Nevertheless, this plan also comes with unlimited calls and SMS to all networks which gives it the slight edge over Digi\u2019s recent  SmartPlan 75 and the  which only offers unlimited calls, but as those two plans are cheaper at RM75 and RM70 respectively, it definitely evens things out.Plus, if you\u2019re counting raw 24/7 data alone, both of the plans offer 7GB mobile data, which is 2GB up from Celcom\u2019s 5GB. But, depending on your weekend data usage, you may use more than 2GB over four weekends which would once again place the plans quite evenly with each other. You will get to bring over any unused quota (up to 5GB) to the next month though, which is a nice touch.What\u2019s more, if you exceed RM225 on your monthly usage, Celcom will give you 1GB of bonus data and 2GB of bonus data if you exceed RM500 per month. This means you\u2019re eligible for up to 3GB of bonus data per month if you spend more than RM500 on your monthly usage.Celcom also provides free music streaming from Yonder for 12 months to their FIRST Gold subscribers. Besides that, you can also be in the running for Celcom\u2019s giveaway promotion where they have given out free  and petrol thus far.Do keep in mind that this plan is only a promotional plan, so it will be available from 2 February to 31 March 2016 only.

{"text": "More juicy goodies have surfaced about the  ahead of the Samsung Unpacked 2016 event  21 February this year. This time, we supposedly get a glimpse at how Samsung are addressing one of the biggest weaknesses of their previous  flagship \u2014 the battery life.According to popular leakster Eldar Murtazin, the Galaxy S7 can last 17 hours of continuous video playback \u201cwith maximum backlight\u201d \u2014 which according to Eldra is a record for this class of devices.Video playback consumes quite a lot of battery power \u2014 especially at maximum brightness on what should be a Quad HD display. If this is true, 17 hours of continuous video playback at maximum brightness is borderline bonkers. Even tablets can\u2019t last 17 hours of continuous video playback.We are curious how they achieved this feat, if it\u2019s true. If we compare the Galaxy S7\u2019s purported 3,000 mAh battery to its predecessor Galaxy S6 active\u2019s 3,500 mAh battery you can sort of get a scale of how insane this claim seems as the Galaxy S6 active can only manage about 10-11 hours of video playback with .What\u2019s more, Murtazin revealed that the Galaxy S7\u2019s battery takes 100 minutes to go from 0-100% charged which is a touch longer than the existing Galaxy S flagships, but we doubt that people will mind that if the battery can truly last as long as Murtazin claims it to be.That said, this is just a rumour with no word on the conditions of the test \u2014 for example, was this streamed or played offline \u2014 so do take it with a pinch of salt.If we add this to the list of purported specs that the Galaxy S7 is said to feature \u2014 a Snapdragon 820 SoC (and likely the Exynos 8890 in different regions), 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a 12-megapixel BRITECELL primary camera and a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera (f/1.7 aperture for both) \u2014 plus waterproofing and a microSD card slot, Samsung\u2019s next flagship looks to be a beast.The S7 is also said to come in two variants, the 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge.

The buttons were fantastically tactile and had a satisfying click, even the home button.The three devices are spec\u2019d accordingly, with the smallest 4.7-inch Galaxy A3 being powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor paired with 1.5GHz on RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It is also powered by a smaller 2,300 mAh battery.On the other hand, the bigger 5.2-inch Galaxy A5 has the same processor as the Galaxy A7 \u2014 a 1.6GHz octa-core Snapdragon SoC \u2014 with the only difference being that the 5.5-inch Galaxy A7 has 3GB of RAM over the Galaxy A5\u2019s 2GB of RAM.Performance across the board was relatively smooth, the most buttery of which is the Galaxy A7. If you place the Galaxy A3 next to either the Galaxy A5 or Galaxy A7, you will notice a slight delay when it comes to switching between multiple applications. In terms of connectivity, all 3 models support Dual-SIM and\u00a0you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 has a dedicated microSD slot, so you can pop in two SIM cards with no compromises.For a series separated by price and tiers, buyers would be happy to know that Samsung didn\u2019t skimp on the camera optics. Well, not by much anyway. All three devices share the same 13-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo, except for the fact that the Galaxy A3\u2019s snapper is missing optical image stabilisation.Though, with a large f/1.9 aperture lens I don\u2019t foresee poor low-light performance to take too much of a hit. That said, we will have to put them through a proper camera test before passing judgement.As these are Samsung devices. it isn\u2019t surprising that they come preloaded with some extra features. While some were fairly gimmicky, there are two features that stand out. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7.It\u2019s supposed to be an improved version over the existing Galaxy S6 and from what we can tell, it\u2019s pretty good. Nowhere near as snappy as a Huawei or Apple sensor, but it\u2019s not bad.Another great feature that we were happy came over to the midrange devices was the double tap home button to quick launch the camera. It works as well as on the other flagship devices.In conclusion, these are really pretty good devices. They\u2019re well built and look really premium but they\u2019re expensive. Very expensive. The Galaxy A3 is priced at RM1,299 while the Galaxy A5 is priced at RM1,599. The top of the range Galaxy A7 is going for RM1,899, which is encroaching flagship price territory. To\u00a0make the Galaxy A series more enticing, all 3 models will come with an extra 32GB microSD card, giving them a total of 48GB of storage out of the box.If you\u2019re looking for something affordable, I can\u2019t honestly recommend any of these devices. But, they do come in pink (EVEN THE CHROME AROUND THE HOME BUTTON IS PINK), so if that tickles your fancy, then these will be the devices for you.", "id": "20"},

According to the researchers who found out about this vulnerability, the malicious code could be triggered when events like callback reminders or birthday notifications were displayed.An estimated 10 million LG G3s were said to be affected by this vulnerability.

But what we didn\u2019t include was this drone. This guy, is a helicopter, a boat, AND a submarine.While drones can let you get some sick wedding shots and awesome drag racing footage, they\u2019re also a little creepy. People can use these little things to spy on you, streaming video directly into their creepy little devices. If you thought you could escape them like you escape bees (diving in the water, in case you\u2019ve never been chased by bees before) you\u2019re sorely mistaken.This flying, swimming and diving device called the Loon Copter was developed by the Oakland University\u2019s Embedded Systems Research Laboratory. It uses a barrel like body, attached to an otherwise regular quadcopter, to act as a ballast tank in a submarine. Filling it with water allows it to sink beneath the surface. It fills in a unique way that rotates the quadcopter ninety degrees in the water, so that the propellers bcome like outboard motors, allowing the drone to navigate under water.It can\u2019t really navigate very deep bodies of water, but as this is nowhere near mass production, we can forsee it diving much deeper in the near future. When you want the drone to fly again, simply empty the tank and it will send the Loon Copter to the surface again.While, swimming and flying drones aren\u2019t all that new, what sets this drone apart is the fact that it uses the clever ballast system. According to the project\u2019s lead scientist, the drone can sit on the surface of the water without any energy usage, as well as change and control depth with little power and no propeller use.Currently, you can\u2019t stream video from the Loon Copter to your smartphone \u2014 so you need to record it for playback later \u2014 but the creators have noted that future versions of this little guy could make use of acoustic modems or repeater buoys to allow for live streaming and control options.Created out of noble aspirations to help with search and rescue operations, this drone could also be misused \u2014 like all good things in life. The end result would come from the user, and while we think that it could be a little scary to give people this much flexibilty when it comes to filming spy footage, there is no denying the cool (and potentially useful) factor of this little device.That said, imagine how much easier filming the next Jaws movie will be with the Loon Copter.

Being one of the company\u2019s first moves into the budget-premium market, the original Galaxy A series was fairly well received and Samsung hopes to replicate that success with the 2016 versions.Much like the original Galaxy A smartphones, these 2016 models feature a premium metal body that is reminiscent of the electronics giant\u2019s flagship  smartphone. The glass panel on the backs of the devices definitely gives them an air of exceptional build quality.Today, they unveiled three phones \u2014 the , , and  \u2014 which are differentiated by price. As these phones are not created as equals, the more expensive Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 have a fingerprint sensor embedded bellow the home button, a big feature that is missing on the Galaxy A3. However, they do share several key features.The first, and most notable of which, is that all three devices \u2014 even the little Galaxy A3 \u2014 sports a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture primary shooter plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 front-facing selfie camera. What separates them is that the Galaxy A3\u2019s primary camera unit does not have OIS while the bigger two do.All three devices also have support for dual-SIM plus an expandable microSD storage slot. Except for the Galaxy A3, the devices don\u2019t use a hybrid-SIM set up so you can use two SIM cards and a microSD card simultaneously. On the Galaxy A3 you will have to sacrifice one SIM for storage expansion.The king of the hill among the Galaxy A lineup, the Galaxy A7 sports a large 5.5-inch full HD Super AMOLED display on the front of the phone. Inside, it\u2019s powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). Giving this smartphone juice is a large 3,300 mAh battery.What is basically a shrunken version of the larger Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A5 comes in at only 5.2-inches, but sports the same Super AMOLED full HD panel found on the Galaxy A7. It packs\u00a0a 1.6GHz octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. For battery, the Galaxy A5 gets a respectable 2,900 mAh unit in the back.Finally, we arrive at the runt of the family, the Galaxy A3. It comes with a small 4.7-inch HD Super AMOLED display and a quad-core 1.5GHz processor on the inside. Helping you with running apps is 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Since it\u2019s the smallest device here, Samsung have fitted it with a small 2.300 mAh battery to keep things going.It is worth noting that none of these devices will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Instead, they will default to the older Android 5.1 Lollipop, though we do expect them to receive the Marshmallow update sometime in the future.If you want to get your hands on these three devices, the Galaxy A7 will go for RM1,899 while the Galaxy A5 retails for RM1,599 and the Galaxy A3 will set you back RM1,299 including GST. All of these devices can be purchased at the official Samsung retailers from 28 January onwards.All purchases will be bundled with a 32GB microSD card free of charge.

{"text": "With the advent of the smartphone, using it at the dinner table (or any table for that matter) has become a norm. When you sit down, you whip out your phone.

When you want to avoid awkward conversations with that family member you\u2019re supposed to be close with but barely remember their name, you have to whip it out.I think you get the gist.It\u2019s a bad habit but most of us are guilty of it. Dinner time should be about the food and the people you\u2019re having it with \u2014 especially when it is a family dinner.

Thankfully, instead of denying any problems the electronics giant admitted that there was a problem with the smartphone\u2019s hardware and said that they would repair the affected devices, though it is unclear if your device needs to still be under warranty for it to be eligible.The problem puts the phone in a boot-up loop where it tries to reset, fails and tries again and again which then proceeds to brick the phone.

Here\u2019s a picture to illustrate my point:So unless you\u2019re typing with your index fingers on the table, or if you tuck the case behind your device, it\u2019s kind of unfeasible. Plus, if you do the latter, you might as well just use the multitasking button to switch between apps.There is promise when it comes to the full QWERTY keyboard though, but even that has it\u2019s problems. Because if the phone/case does not have a kickstand it\u2019ll just end up looking like this really  for a .Either way, it looks like this is merely a concept and could do with a lot more polishing. The good news is that we might not have to wait for the rumoured \u201c\u201d to (hopefully) test this case out because Microsoft Research is supposedly \u201cin deep talks\u201d with the Lumia division to turn\u00a0these flip covers into real products.What do you guys think?

{"text": "One of the first of its kind, the Acer Predator 8 is essentially the one of the world firsts in terms of tablets built for gaming.\u00a0As far as the design and build go, the Predator 8 isn\u2019t your bog standard tablet. Coming in at about 8 inches in size, the tablet has a rather unique shape; with four front-facing speakers (called the Predator Quadio) with one situated at each corner of the tablet.The tablet is surprisingly light considering how chunky it looks and how solid it feels; weighing in at a paltry 350g with the battery in.The sides are also shaped in a way that you have a\u00a0decent place to\u00a0grip without your hands getting in the way of said speakers if you want to play games in landscape mode. One minor gripe is the placement of its microUSB port at the top of the device as\u00a0the charging cable will get in the way if you are playing games while charging.The rear of the device is home to\u00a0a brushed metal plate with the Predator logo on it and is the only bit of the tablet that is made of solid metal. The rest of the Predator 8 is made of a combination of plastic and rubber that only simulates that metal finish but still looks good regardless. Due to its unique shape you probably won\u2019t find many 3rd party cases for it, unfortunately, but .Also, we feel we need to mention that this is the first (compact) gaming tablet that has a form of haptic feedback called the Predator TacSense. There are two haptic motors, with one placed on each side. So depending on the games you are playing it might vibrate to your actions, even the startup screen has the tablet buzzing to the logo.

Clad in an all-metal unibody, the honor 5X comes with a 5.5-inch full HD and packs a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage.It also comes with a 13MP f/2.0 primary camera with a dual-LED flash for taking photos. Selfies are taken care of by the front-facing 5MP f/2.4 snapper. The 5X also sports a large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0, plus a dedicated dual-SIM tray \u2014 so none of that hybrid-SIM nonsense. The device will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with the EMUI 3.1 skin on top.As you can tell by the name, the honor 7 Enhanced is slightly improved version of the old (but gold) honor 7. It still packs the same 2.2GHz octa-core Kirin 935 processor paired with 3GB of RAM thrumming under a 5.2-inch full-HD display. It also brings over the honor 7\u2019s 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash plus an 8MP front-facing camera with its own LED flash.What has changed then? It has more storage \u2014 double in fact at 32GB from the old 16GB found on the original honor 7. While it may seem like a simple change it is a significant one as one of the biggest qualms users had of this otherwise excellent device was the fact that it had a measly 16GB of onboard storage, which as we all know is not going to be enough especially with that 20MP snapper.This is also the first non-Nexus device to come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box that has been launched in Malaysia.If you want to get your hands on either of these devices, you can register your interest on Vmall.my from 26 January onwards.

{"text": "Many have been waiting for the arrival of the  on local shores, and it isn\u2019t particularly hard to see why. A metal build, a nice full HD display and a snappy fingerprint sensor are hard to come by at this end of the market. While honor have not announced when the device will go on sale or how much it would cost, we got to take a quick look at this all-metal midrange device.A premium metal construction is almost a necessity these days. While  that a metal body is all that, smartphone manufacturers and people who want to show off certainly do. Has honor delivered with the 5X?Well, I can tell you that it definitely feels better than the more expensive honor 7. The front of the device is nothing to shout about, but when you move to the sides of the device, you can see where all of honor\u2019s effort went. They talked endlessly about the sandblasting they had to do to keep the device feeling smooth in the hand and they did accomplish that to a certain extent.The sides are nicely chamfered (ala-Nexus 6P) to help with grip and very smooth to the touch. They decided to go with a brushed metal look for the back plate but the moment your fingers touch it, the panel feels in no way shape or form brushed. It was smooth as a baby\u2019s bottom \u2014 which may appeal to some, but I like a little grain and roughness.There are other niggles that come from the buttons. While they had nice tactile feedback which felt really premium, the power button shifts around a little too much and if you apply pressure to the center of the volume rockers you will be greeted with an incredibly unpleasant flex.Since this isn\u2019t really a high-end device, you can\u2019t really expect much when it comes to performance. It sports a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. With proper optimisation, those specs would do fine for light to medium tasks, but from our brief hands-on it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.Switching between applications was slow and sluggish. Exiting the camera app was the most painful thing to watch as the frames stuttered and choked. It was a disaster. That said, this can probably be fixed with a quick update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.The honor 5X comes with a decent 13-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with a dual-LED flash mounted on the rear, right above the fingerprint scanner. It\u2019s a pretty decent snapper with a host of features as is the hallmark of EMUI\u2019s camera app. Stuff like beautification, HDR, panorama are all bundled into it. Shots from that sensor are decent with reasonable amounts of colour\u00a0accuracy and detail. The front 5MP f/2.4 selfie cam also takes reasonably good pictures, though we would have liked if it was a little wider for those crucial wefies.Its Huawei-made fingerprint scanner is as fantastic as ever. I loved the accuracy and speed though I would have appreciated a little haptic feedback when it successfully reads your finger but that\u2019s me nitpicking. The honor 5X\u2019s sensor only needs 6 taps to register your fingerprint yet it has an amazing level of accuracy.As is a common theme in Huawei made devices, the fingerprint scanner at the back is more than simply a fingerprint scanner. You can swipe down on it to pull down your notifications, as well as hold it to exit your application and return to the home screen. It also allows you to take photos by tapping it though we found that quite pointless and horribly unergonomic.It also has a curious function that lets the fingerprint scanner act as a back button allowing you to tap it once to go back to your previous task. So what if I\u2019ve enabled the camera single tap to take a photo? Design oversight? It also lacks the swipe left and swipe right to scroll through pictures or text.All in all, it\u2019s a pretty decent budget premium device with an okay camera and decent specs. All it needs is some proper optimisation (please patch ASAP) and a little skill when taking photographs. It\u2019s a decent all-rounder but it faces tough competition from the likes of the  and the  (when it arrives) even if our estimate of a sub RM1,000 price tag comes true.", "id": "41"},

The Galaxy A series will\u00a0share the Galaxy S6\u2019s good looks with its glass front and back panels held together by a metal frame. The edges are rounded for a better grip and feel in the hand.The devices also get a bump, across the line, up to a 13-megapixel f/1,9 aperture rear shooter and a front-facing 5MP f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates the Galaxy A3\u2019s camera from the other two bigger devices is the lack of OIS though we suspect people who are going for a budget device won\u2019t mind this too much. The best part? All three devices have a Pink Gold colour option \u2014 which we hope they will bring to Malaysia as well.Sitting at the top of the Galaxy A\u2019s pecking order is the largest of the trio with a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display. On the inside, the devices will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Thankfully the internal storage is expandable via microSD to up to 128GB of extra internal storage. The Galaxy A7 also gets a large 3,300 mAh battery.Next up we have the Galaxy A5 which is slightly smaller at 5.2\u2033 but with the same full-HD (1920\u00d71080) Super AMOLED display. Powering the device will be a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. However, it gets a smaller 2,900 mAh battery for juice.Rounding out the trio is the smallest sibling, the Galaxy A3. Sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280\u00d7720) Super AMOLED display with a quad-core 1.5GHz processor running on the inside. It also packs 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. The device will be drawing power from a 2,300 mAh battery.The trio of devices will not\u00a0launch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow though, as they\u2019re set to come with Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box. That said, we do expect them to get Marshmallow within a reasonable amount of time. The two higher end devices \u2014 the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 \u2014 also sport a fingerprint scanner.Those are mighty specs for a budget device, but only if these devices are actually priced like a budget device. Based on the Singaporean pricing of the Galaxy A line, that doesn\u2019t really look to be the case.

Then again, Singapore\u2019s prices have generally been much higher than in Malaysia. If we\u2019re going off last year\u2019s Malaysian pricing, the Galaxy A3 went for RM899, Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199 and the Galaxy A7 had an RM1,499 price tag.

{"text": "As the supposed March   approaches, more and more leaks have come out on both the Apple Watch 2 and now what is supposed to be the . Or 5e. Whatever the name though, this Apple smartphone is said to have a smaller 4-inch display and should be unveiled in March. Now a video has surfaced, claiming to be the \u201cFirst real 4-inch iPhone 2016\u2033 video leak, the short 40-second clip \u2014 if true \u2014 does give at least some information on Apple\u2019s purported next product.Yeah, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6/6s. In fact, it looks so much like an iPhone 6/6s that many are calling this video a fake and that the reason it looks small-ish is because the guy manning the camera has large hands. Honestly, it does look kind of sketchy and as 9to5Mac pointed out, the speaker grille ratios were pretty similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone so that does add some credence to the \u201cbig-hands\u201d justification.It is said that MIC Gadget has a reasonable history in obtaining devices for a hands-on ahead of time so maybe there is some truth to all of this.\u00a0But, there is no way of identifying if this is actually the new iPhone 6C or if it is just a regular iPhone 6. There\u2019s tape over many of the important identifier bits, there is no comparison with the iPhone 6/6s, and there is really nothing in the room that can tell us anything about the scale of this device.Considering how good  have gotten, it honestly wouldn\u2019t be too surprising if the phone in the video is actually a clone made to look like it could be the iPhone 6c. There have been many fakes in the past, some running an iOS skinned version of Android, some just flat out running Android, but it seems that there are plenty of people who can\u2019t tell the difference:Clearly many are willing to believe anything people tell them, so perhaps this guy is banking on the gullibility of society? Who knows. What we do know is that you shouldn\u2019t believe everything someone tells you. So, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt.What do you think of this device and its \u201chands-on\u201d video? Does it look legit? Would you buy one? Why did they make it look exactly the same as the iPhone 6/6s instead of going down the iPhone 5c route? Let us know in the comments below.[, ]", "id": "57"},
{"text": "A popular saying when it comes to these little devices we carry around\u00a0all day called smartphones.\u00a0It\u2019s amazing what our devices can do with a dedicated app, especially when it comes to social media applications.\u00a0If you\u2019ve ever used the  app versus visiting it on the browser, you will know what I mean.Unfortunately, some applications are really heavy and take up a lot of resources, slowing down slower phones. One of which is the  application. It takes up a whopping amount of space in your internal storage versus something like Instagram that only uses a fraction of the amount, but because this is the only and most complete application for browsing Facebook, we begrudgingly use it.Common perception would be that the mobile browser version is always a whole lot worse than the app, but according to Android Central, that isn\u2019t the case. Russell Holly wrote an  about how he uninstalled Facebook on his Android device and it turned out to be a better experience than he expected.That got us thinking, is the Facebook app really worth it? Well, for what we believe is the majority of FB users, we doubt it. Here are the five reasons we think  users should ditch the Facebook application.If you\u2019re on it for a moderate amount of time a day, you will notice that it becomes one of the biggest battery drainers on your phone. Plus, it is a performance hog too, something Russell also notes, so it will significantly slow down the performance of lower-end devices.If you\u2019ve ever installed the Facebook app, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d notice the ridiculous amount of permissions they \u201crequire\u201d to function properly.

{"text": "By now, I\u2019m sure most of you have seen a video making its rounds on social media, and even , about a guy with a robotic arm that he built in a garage to help him overcome the limitations of his paralysed left hand. Sounds amazing right?Yeah, we think this sounds too good to be true. Here\u2019s why.I Wayan Sutawan, affectionately referred to as Tawan, suffered a minor stroke six months ago which paralysed his left arm. Because he\u2019s a mechanic of sorts, one can imagine that having a paralysed left hand can be quite a cumbersome thing. So, rather than sit around and whine about it, Tawan set to work and in two months created a robotic arm out of spare parts he had around his workshop.He can control the robot arm via a headband around his forehead that picks up his brain signals and allows him to control the arm movement accordingly. Based on the video, not only can he lift objects and move his arm around, he can also pick up and hold on to rather delicate objects.So why do we think this miraculous feat has more in common with the Boy Who Cried Wolf than it does with Iron Man?That means the body part \u2014 the muscles, the nerve cells, the tendons and ligaments \u2014 are perfectly functional, there is just nothing telling them to move. So, if it\u2019s the brain that can\u2019t issue the command, how then can his \u201cbrainwave detector\u201d \u2014 that looks like a bunch of LEDs strapped around his head with duct tape \u2014 detect\u00a0the brainwaves issued by a part of the brain that no longer functions?Plus, even if that contraption around his head\u00a0 pick up the brainwaves\u00a0from dead/damaged braincells that can no longer issue commands via a human\u2019s regular nervous system, where on earth did he store the processor needed to make sense of those brainwaves (or even identify the correct ones) and translate them into mechanical motor functions? How did he develop such sophisticated programming? What kind of supercomputing power is being used to digest all that data?While the motors and the hydraulics for the upper segments of the arm could possibly pass off as motors to facilitate movement, the glove that controls Tawan\u2019s finer finger movements don\u2019t have any actuators at all. So how could this contraption allow him to make the finger movements necessary to pick up and grip the solder in the video?Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain aren\u2019t exactly new. Take a look at this  by The Guardian on a DARPA-funded research project for robotic arms that can feel. What the scientists at Johns Hopkins university Applied Physics Laboratory did was have the electrodes from the prosthetic hand inserted into his sensory and motor cortexes so that he could\u00a0not only control the hand with thought, he could also feel and sense when his \u201cfingers\u201d were touched.Once again, this is proof that in order for your brain to control a prosthetic arm, the necessary cortexes would have to be able to send a signal and function properly first. Another thing to note is that\u00a0if a project led by the brilliant scientists of Johns Hopkins needed funding from a US military agency like DARPA to succeed, how on earth did Tawan manage to build one himself out of spare parts?What is more likely is that the man simply has a weak arm that needs some motorised help to actually function properly. In fact, if you pay close attention to his left arm when he is inserting it into his mechanical contraption, you can see his wrist flick upwards before it enters the sleeve.Everything about this story seems too sketchy to be true. The fact that a simple mechanic from a rural town could just one day up and build something so advanced from spare parts should have raised at least a few flags. Add \u201cbrainwave-controlled\u201d to that description and you would have a beautiful script to a story designed for the big screen. You would have Iron Man actually. And Tony Stark doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 no matter how hard Elon Musk tries.[, ]", "id": "60"},

{"text": "We\u2019ve touched on how good the Nexus 6P\u2019s fingerprint sensor is in the past with its quick unlock speed and high accuracy despite only needing six taps to register your finger. You can also use it to authenticate Google Play as well as Android Pay purchases, but we\u2019ve always hoped it could do more especially since Google baked fingerprint support into Android 6.0 Marshmallow itself.Thanks to the open API though,\u00a0now you can use your fingerprint to lock specific apps in your phone \u2014 but there\u2019s a catch.App locking is no new concept. It simply allows you to lock specific applications, requiring either a password or pin to access that particular app. Let\u2019s say, your friends are the nosy bunch and the moment they get their hands on your device, they like to head into the gallery to look at all your embarrassing failed selfie attempts. Thanks to an app locker, you can stop that by protecting access to that application with an app locker. Some devices even have that natively in their Android skin, while others even allow you to lock entire folders of applications.Entering a password is  last century and developer SurpriseToYou have come up with AppLock -Fingerprint-, an app that lets you (if you\u2019re on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) lock individual applications in your phone with your fingerprint. Although we must note the incredibly sketchy developer name. When I\u2019m using a security app, I don\u2019t really want it to surprise me. To use it, the app requires you to grant it three different levels of access \u2014 Apps with usage access, Draw over other apps, and Activate device administrator.Once in, it\u2019s a simple task of choosing which application you want locked by flicking the toggle next to that specific app. Once you launch the app that you\u2019ve locked, the AppLock -Fingerprint- overlay will draw over the app and ask for your fingerprint.But, true to the developer\u2019s name, here\u2019s the surprise \u2014 when that overlay pops up and \u201clocks\u201d your app, should you receive a banner notification from WhatsApp, the overlay drops and you have access to said \u201clocked\u201d app without ever inputting your fingerprint. What kind of security is this?!While the fact that this app runs on ads without a way to disable it is a little annoying, I think the far more pressing issue is the fact that you can break the \u201cencryption\u201d with a single banner notification. If, however, that doesn\u2019t bother you and you\u2019re interested in this app, you can get it from the PlayStore.

Based on the diagram, it does indeed look like the phone will have a flat design unlike that of the previous  and  models.Besides that the diagram confirms that the G5\u2019s volume control buttons will be placed at the side of the smartphone while the power button remains put beneath the camera module (likely where the fingerprint sensor will reside as well). It does seems kind of silly to have a clickable button at the back, but then again we\u2019ve doubted the back button placement before and that turned out pretty well in the end.Speaking of that camera module, while it does look like a massive module, it seems that there will only be one camera at the back. Judging from the cutout in the middle plus the earlier concepts by CNet Korea, the rest of to module will be home to the dual-tone LED flash and a laser autofocus.It also looks like the G5 will indeed be thinner, taller and wider than the LG G4, measuring in at\u00a0149.4 x 73.9 x 8.2mm versus the G4\u2019s\u00a0148.9 x 76.1 x 6.3-9.8mm.Unfortunately, while this diagram does confirm a lot about the device, there is no mention of specs or what exactly the body will be made of.

However, since Samsung made the oversight in the first place, we\u2019re sure many of the early Galaxy Note5 adopters must be pissed that their device doesn\u2019t have this hardware fix.Plus, since Samsung seems to have ninja-fixed this, it doesn\u2019t look like they want others to find out about it which is kind of a bummer.

Suffice to say we will be bringing you live updates from the ground on that very day.Of the two devices launched, the honor 5X is definitely the more interesting one. The 5X is honor\u2019s answer to the , with it\u2019s full metal build as well as rear mounted fingerprint scanner. The 5.5\u2033 device will sport a full HD screen plus a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor \u2014 a departure from their home-grown Kirin SoCs. Nevertheless, the Snapdragon 616 will be paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage.What it does have over the Redmi Note 3 is a dedicated microSD card slot which allows you to expand that small internal memory. Because of the fact that honor ditched the hybrid SIM set up, users can use two SIM cards and the microSD storage simultaneously. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with their EMUI 3.1 skin running over it.For camera optics, the device will sport a 13MP f/2.0 primary shooter with dual-LED flash to help out in low light conditions, as well as a 5-megapixel f/2.4 front shooter. The phone will draw power from a fairly large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0.The honor 5X is going for RMB1,099 in China (around RM730) which is only a touch higher than the Redmi Note 3\u2019s 16GB version and the same price as the 32GB version. In Malaysia you can get an imported Redmi Note 3 () for under RM1,000, so the question is: How low will honor go?The honor 7 Enhanced isn\u2019t all that different than the already good un-enhanced version which we  a lot. The only enhancement is the fact that this device will now come with 32GB of internal storage and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.While the bump in storage\u00a0from 16GB\u00a0might not be that big of a deal to some, many felt that one of the biggest problems with the honor 7 was the lack of storage space. Now with double that, this device just got a whole lot better.Besides that, this will be the first non-nexus smartphone in Malaysia to be officially sold with Android M out-of-the-box. So, you get to have all those awesome Marshmallow features to yourself.The device features a 5.2\u2033 full HD display on the front with an octa-core Kirin 935 processor clocked at 2.2GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. Camera-wise it has a 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash. The front camera is an 8MP unit with its own front-facing flash to help with those low-light selfies.In China, the honor 7 Enhanced is going for RMB 1,999 (around RM1330) \u2014 the same price as the honor 7, with the original getting a bump down to RMB1,799 (around RM1,200) \u2014 which is quite the steal.

{"text": "Sometimes, a tiny crack is all it takes to cause severe damage to an object. It\u2019s these tiny cracks that we don\u2019t see because they\u2019re often impossible to spot in, for example, your car\u2019s windscreen. However, these cracks become the first weaknesses in any object and could potentially lead to something really bad somewhere down the road.Well, a University of Illinois research has led to a  coating that could be an important early damage warning system, making it easier to find cracks or damage in particular objects by making them bleed.This polymer coating consists of tiny micro beads that crack open, causing a chemical reaction that will visibly highlight any damage with colour. These beads are pH sensitive so any damage will cause a colour change \u2014 from yellow to red \u2014 without the need for additional chemicals. The bigger the crack or scratch, the deeper the object will bleed as more capsules are affected.What\u2019s good about this coating is that it works on multiple kinds of polymers that can coat metals, other polymers and even glass. Plus, they\u2019re apparently not too expensive either, but no specific quote of a price was given.\u00a0What\u2019s more, the coating shows no sign of degradation \u2014 meaning the microcapsules will stay intact until actual cracks or damage happens.The application possibilities of this technology are endless. Since only 5% of a polymer needs to be microcapsules to have a strong damage indication ability, you can apply it to a myriad of things. While this can prove useful to big projects like rocket launches into space as well as deep sea exploration, there are also plenty of everyday products that can benefit.Off the top of my head would be your action cam/smartphone\u2019s waterproof casing. Those things are transparent so it\u2019s incredible difficult to find small cracks in their seal, but all it takes is a little nick to let the water in and damage your precious device. Planes and vehicles stand to benefit from this polymer too, as important components in these machines can be coated to allow for early damage detection which could potentially save lives. It\u2019s kind of nice to think that your car could bleed for you before you have to bleed yourself.[, ]", "id": "68"},

It is also said to have an 8MP/5MP rear-front camera combo with an LED flash.What is interesting is that they also note that this could very well be the last Lumia device of 2016 as they said both the rumoured Lumia 850 and Lumia 750 have been  in July of 2015. Then again that article also said that the Lumia 550 was cancelled, so, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt.With the abrupt cancellation of both Lumia devices,\u00a0it is unlikely that Microsoft will sit on their hands and not launch any more mobile devices this year. So if there are no more Lumias what else does Microsoft have in their pipeline?

{"text": "Big smartphone manufacturers seem to love adding variants to their popular devices so you can pretty much expect at least two versions of what is essentially the same smartphone (or at least under the same line) that will cater to different people\u2019s needs.  isn\u2019t bucking this trend as new information has surfaced that they\u2019re launching four different variants of their upcoming  handset \u2014 one more than last year. What\u2019s more, the fourth device will feature a dual rear camera setup.According to a report on VentureBeat by Evan Blass, otherwise known as , Huawei\u2019s P9 lineup will include the regular P9, a budget-friendly P9lite, a larger P9max as well as an unnamed \u201cfeature-enhanced P9\u2033. Although Blass noted that his source fell short of dubbing it a premium model, this enhanced P9 is said to feature a larger screen (though not as large as the P9max) more RAM, more internal storage as well as a dual 12-megapixel rear-facing camera.This isn\u2019t new for the Chinese smartphone manufacturer however as they\u2019ve already tried the dual-camera set up on the 2014-2015 . In fact, this new P9\u2019s camera is supposed to be a second generation upgrade of that very dual-camera. Therefore, it will likely mean that the P9\u2019s dual-camera will offer the same additional features afforded by the honor 6 Plus\u2019 like post-capture refocus, simulated aperture adjustment and filter application plus what VentureBeat says will be \u201ceven more unique capabilities\u201d as this camera concept has been further refined.Is two better than one? If our  on the upcoming LG G5 is any indication, it would appear smartphone manufacturers definitely think so, as that device is rumoured to sport not only a dual-screen setup like the LG V10\u00a0but also a dual rear mounted camera. That said, these are merely rumours as there has been no official confirmation beyond a person with alleged knowledge of Huawei so take this with a grain of salt.One thing is for sure though none of the P9 variants will feature a QHD resolution screen (2560\u00d71440 pixels). As with all Huawei devices (except the Nexus 6P which we can all argue can be considered more of a Google device), the company feels that the slightly better screen and image quality offered by a QHD screen just isn\u2019t worth the shorter battery life. We were pretty  with the Mate S\u2019 battery life, so maybe they do know what they\u2019re doing.As far as specs are concerned, Blass\u2019 source didn\u2019t reveal anything, but we did come across a device that posted a  on Geekbench that we believe could be the Kirin 950-powered Huawei P9. With that kind of horsepower and now a dual-camera, suffice to say we\u2019re excited.Despite all of this information and anticipation, Blass indicates that Huawei will not launch these smartphones during the Barcelona Mobile World Congress\u2019 timeframe, choosing instead to give them a dedicated launch several weeks after MWC. However, it is said that Huawei is expected to unveil a Surface Book-like 2-in-1 in Barcelona next month but there are unfortunately no details on this product for the time being.[]", "id": "76"},

With this new version, though, 2015\u2019s report is the first cross-platform ranking report and my goodness was it an interesting one. While we weren\u2019t that surprised that the  was #1 on their list, we were shocked at how MUCH further it was from the competition. Let me give you a hint: 132k.According to the popular cross-platform benchmarker, the average score of an iPhone 6s Plus is 132,620 points, the only device to break the 100k mark in 2015.On paper, this gap doesn\u2019t seem possible as the iPhone 6s Plus is powered by a dual-core Twister A9 chip that is clocked at a tame 1.84GHz \u00a0and a PowerVR GT7600 GPU paired with (a frankly depressing) 2GB of RAM. Comparatively, the second placed  packs a monstrous next-gen octa-core Kirin 950 SoC \u2014 four Cortex A72 CPU cores clocked at 2.3GHz, four Cortex A53 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz and a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU \u2014 plus 4GB of RAM.Yet somehow the iPhone 6s Plus outperforms it by about 30%. It is worth noting that the top 3 performing phones all run on full HD displays so they have less pixels to push compared to their Quad-HD competitors.As we move down the ladder, we find the Samsung Exynos 7420 chipsets occupying places three to five with the  leading the pack. Not surprising since it only runs a 1080p full-HD display opposed to the  and \u2018s Quad-HD display.Just after the Samsung chips comes 2014\u2019s , scoring a respectable 80,554 average score.

Now the word \u201coptical zoom\u201d may not be a term everyone recognises. Some of you might be thinking that your current smartphones can zoom jolly well, so why would you bother about this device?You see, the zoom commonly found on your smartphone camera is what people call \u201cdigital zoom\u201d which essentially crops the image to a smaller frame and enlarges to make it seem like you\u2019re bringing the subject closer to you. No lens movement happens within the camera module. On the other hand, conventional DSLRs and their respective lenses use \u201coptical zoom\u201d which works when the different elements that make up a lens move around to refract light differently, bringing the image closer to you.The biggest difference though is that when you use digital zoom to zoom in on a subject, you lose quality, because you are no longer using the full image \u2014 rather you\u2019re only using a cropped fraction of it. Optical zoom then is the way to go if you want to zoom (but not with your feet) and you don\u2019t want to lose image quality at the same time.If the benefits are so great, why don\u2019t more manufacturers equip their smartphones with optical zoom? The biggest reason is size. With more than one element in your lens, the whole camera module tends to get pretty ginormous. Think \u00a0or the . However, with ASUS\u2019s 13-megapixel camera on the ZenFone Zoom, they have used a special dual-periscope design to mount the camera horizontally across the back of the smartphone, letting them hide the camera bump with the ZenFone\u2019s signature curved back.But, to say that this tiny lens array strapped to the back of a smartphone is on par with those on a DSLR\u2019s lens might be pushing it.

{"text": "Yesterday,  officially launched the much anticipated  on Malaysia and we got to spend some time with their new flagship device.\u00a0Here\u2019s what we think of it. Do note that the white unit with the black camera module is a prototype given to professional photographer Peter Tan.Of course, this device\u2019s party piece lies in its massive camera module that dominates the back of the phone. Its 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor has a 10-element f/2.7-4.8 aperture\u00a0lens that utilises a dual-periscope horizontal-mount design allowing it to not only have a massive 3x optical zoom, but also maintain a relatively thin form factor. Besides that the primary camera comes with other goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash. To help the camera out in low light, the ZenFone Zoom comes with ASUS\u2019 Pixel Master 2.0 technology which is renown for its low light and long exposure capabilities.If 13-megapixels isn\u2019t enough, ASUS have bundled a Super Resolution function into the camera which allows it to take gigantic 52-megapixel photos, by stitching four 13MP shots together for more detail and clarity. While the sample shots on display (taken by Peter Tan) looked rather impressive, we would have to fully test out the functions for ourselves before making a decision.Being a camera-centric phone, the smartphone comes with dedicated camera hardware buttons \u2014 a dedicated shutter and video record button \u2014 which were awesome and tactile. The device also has equally tactile dedicated zoom keys that can double as volume rockers when not in the camera app.Zooming in and out with the keys was pretty satisfying as the phone gives you a little buzz when it hits the maximum 3x optical zoom. We did notice that launching the camera from the shutter button (which you can do by holding it down) was a little slow (maybe 2-3) seconds. Besides that, the shutter speed and time between shots were not as snappy as something like an iPhone 6s or a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+.However, it does have a complete manual mode with full manual controls that can be easily accessed via a tap of the M button located to the top of the on-screen shutter button.What we were impressed with was the macro capabilities of this device. ASUS boasts a 5cm macro focal distance and from our brief testing, you could get pretty darn close to the subject and still focus with no problems.\u00a0The front camera is an average 5MP f/2.0 unit with a wide-angle lens and support for Pano Selfie.For a better understanding of this device\u2019s cameras and what optical versus digital zoom really means, stay tuned for our camera comparison.Spec wise, the ZenFone Zoom isn\u2019t all that different from ASUS\u2019 previous flagship, the . It has an updated quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor clocked at 2.5GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (via microSD up to 64GB) storage.The smartphone also comes running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS\u2019 ZenUI running on top. It\u2019s a shame that it isn\u2019t a more updated version of Android but we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update. Connectivity wise, the device will have a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot and will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi.From our brief hands-on, though, the device handles itself quite well, not stuttering or lagging when switching between applications, then again with 4GB of RAM and a high-end Intel chip, this isn\u2019t really surprising.Being a premium phone, it is definitely built well. The nice rounded metal rails were fabulous to hold in the hand and the back curved nicely to fit in our palms. The camera unit is barely noticeable, letting you believe that it could just be a normal camera. Kudos to ASUS for hiding such a beast of a lens array.ASUS says that the leather on the back of the device is real leather, not some faux nonsense, and we were inclined to believe them\u2026until we took the rear panel off. But, when\u00a0we held the panel by itself, we started to doubt their claims. That said, the stitching around the \u201cergonomic hump\u201d is real as we could move the thread around.It felt flimsy and plasticky so be careful when you rip that baby off. The bump on the back to help ergonomics was interesting, to say the least, and we quite liked it since it helped a little with the ergonomics.

{"text": "recently went \u201cglobal\u201d and everyone got very excited. We\u2019ve all heard good things about this streaming service, from the shows they have to the quality of their stream plus all the Netflix exclusives like Daredevil and Jessica Jones. It\u2019s gotten so popular that we see it mentioned in TV shows themselves, that one time in Suits when Mike Ross wanted to piss Edward Darby off for example.But, when we took a hard look at their catalogue from our Malaysian accounts, we were quite bummed out that there were so . Even popular comedy series How I Met Your Mother wasn\u2019t there. So the craftier of us went ahead and used VPNs (Virtual Private Network) and proxies\u00a0to mask our IP addresses and as a result, gain more access to their content.Well, it seems like Netflix has had enough of our scheming ways and has said openly that they\u2019re putting a stop to VPN users once and for all.For those of you who don\u2019t know what a VPN or proxy does, it basically masks your IP address, preventing a website \u2014 Netflix for example \u2014 from finding out where you are connecting from. So, with a VPN or proxy you can set it up to have the site or app detect that you\u2019re connecting from an American IP address, for example, then the region locked site would\u00a0grant you access to their content as if you were coming from the US. If you\u2019d like a more detailed explanation you can head on over to Gizmodo\u2019s article on .In short when it comes to Netflix, this allows you to bypass region restrictions and circumvent the walls Netflix have put up (because of licensing,\u00a0censorship and other technical reasons) and have access to whatever content you want \u2014 something Netflix is clearly upset about.In a blog statement by Netflix Vice President of Content Delivery Architecture David Fullagar, he said that Netflix would continue to enforce content licensing according to geographical location. However, they did say that they were working on making all their content available to all their subscribers \u2014 something they anticipate being able to do.For now, though, they\u2019re focusing on blocking proxies and ensuring that you can only access content from your own region. Although they didn\u2019t say exactly how or when they would block the proxies aside from a vague \u201cas technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it\u201d line.One possible way we could see them doing it is locking your account by credit card. For example, if you wanted to use an American account, you would have to have an American credit card, likewise, if you\u2019re using a Malaysian credit card you can only access the Malaysian Netflix content. Although they could also take more drastic measures and force you to use your IC/identification numbers to register. Though we doubt it since it would cause some amount of hindrance to user experience.

Another radical change is the volume rocker and power buttons are now purportedly moved towards the sides. Despite having a full unibody design, the source also claims that the battery is still removable. How is this even possible? Apparently their engineers have made a mechanism that allows the bottom portion to be removed, giving you access to its battery. The lower end of the device will get a drawer-like design that helps to keep dust and water away. When we think of a full unibody design with a removable battery, we thought of the old  that was released about 6 years ago. It had a sturdy body made from a single block of aluminum and the removable cap at the bottom gives you access to its SIM, microSD and removable battery. This was the time when HTC was at its peak.

This is to facilitate the push towards Microsoft\u2019s new operating system, . When we say terminate, we don\u2019t mean that your Windows 8 machine will just up and die or stop working straight away, it\u2019s just that Windows 8 won\u2019t receive updates, security fixes and bug fixes it used to get.If you are running on Windows 8 though, don\u2019t worry because there is a simple way around this issue.Besides the obvious upgrade to Windows 10 being one of the solutions, Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1, which based on their lifecycle fact sheet, will continue to receive updates for two more years until January 9, 2018. If you\u2019ve read the horror stories of Windows 10\u2019s ominous privacy terms and want to avoid such dangers by staying on an older version of Windows, you can now do so.As you can see, today also marks the end of Windows 7 service Pack 1\u2019s mainstream support \u2014 but don\u2019t worry you will still continue to receive security updates as extended support will go all the way to January 14, 2020. All you lose is the mainstream support which includes free incident support, warranty claims and fixes for non-security and security bugs, plus design changes and feature requests. Based on statistics published by Tech Crunch, 2-3% of PCs (30-40 million devices) are still running on Windows 8, while Windows 7 is said to currently be in use on .Why is it important to keep your system updated and within Microsoft\u2019s support lifecycle? Well, the first and most obvious reason is security. As operating systems lose their security updates, they become vulnerable to new malware and potential attacks, which puts your information as well as your system at risk. Microsoft, via updates, patches these new vulnerabilities when they come up so that these exploitable holes are fixed. Once that support ends, you lose all protection against future vulnerabilities.Besides Windows 8, Microsoft is also terminating support for older versions of IE, urging users to upgrade either to IE 11 or Microsoft\u2019s new Edge browser. I\u2019ve personally never been a fan of IE because of how messy the interface is and how clunky it makes browsing feel, so it comes as a surprise to me that 20% of the desktop web browser market still uses the older versions of IE (8, 9, 10) as their daily driver. Unfortunately for those people, they will have to migrate to either the new IE 11, Microsoft Edge, or other third party browsers like  or , or else they would be facing security vulnerabilities when browsing the web.Microsoft Edge, the built-in browser on Windows 10, promised much in terms of functionality and performance. Things like extensions were supposed to come to Edge to keep it up to par with browsers like Google\u2019s Chrome but til this day, there is still  anywhere. I don\u2019t know about you guys but I definitely need my extensions.Killing off old software is nothing new, and I\u00a0welcome it because not only does it allow software developers to focus on their latest and greatest product, it also allows them to free up valuable resources to focus on new projects.

It resembles closely with the R7 Lite and it gets a couple of upgrades in the hardware department.At the front, the OPPO F1 gets a compact-sized 5\u2033 display that does a HD 720 resolution of 1280\u00d7720. Powering the processor is an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 Octa-Core unit, similar to the newly announced , and it gets 3GB of RAM for all your multi-tasking needs. On-board there\u2019s 16GB of storage which can be expanded to 128GB extra with microSD. This is a Dual-SIM device that accepts a MicroSIM and Nano-SIM, but you would lose a slot if you need to use a microSD card. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP f/2.2 main camera with PDAF and it is assisted with a single LED flash. Meanwhile, the front gets an 8MP f/2.0 shooter with built-on beautification features for the perfect selfie. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500mAh battery which is slightly more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. Out of the box, the F1 runs on ColorOS 2.1 that\u2019s based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. In Vietnam, the OPPO F1 is priced at 6,490,000 Dong, which is about RM1,270 if converted directly. As an earlybird bonus, the first 1,500 buyers will get a pair of iLike Bluetooth headset thrown in for free. The OPPO F1 is now available in Gold and we expect them to release a Rose Gold version later on. With Malaysia as a key market, they are likely to release the OPPO F1 here very soon.

Additionally, the device is said to have a higher QHD 2K resolution display and it could possibly house the 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage variant.Other than that, both devices should be identical \u2014 sporting a Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a suggested screen size that can range from 5 to 5.2-inches. The smartphone is also said to have a 3,600 mAh battery and become official by January 21, though sales are only expected to start on February 8.Of course, this is all just guess work based on rumours at this point and for all we know it could be the other way around. That said, this isn\u2019t the first time Xiaomi have done two versions of the same device as the  and  are essentially the same device except for the fact that the Pro variant has a more powerful processor plus more RAM and a higher resolution screen.If these rumours of the Mi 5 are true though, it would be the first time that the Chinese company have gone with two completely different back constructions on a phone.

One of its strongest selling points is the massive 4,100 mAh battery which Xiaomi says will give you an 80% improvement in talk time duration compared to its predecessor.

As we\u2019ve covered stories before about small  or , we thought it\u2019d be fitting to follow up with a bigger modular device \u2014 a TV.Yup,  have come up with a modular TV that can split into several different parts and dance around your wall like something you\u2019d find in a bachelor pad from the future. If you can\u2019t wrap your head around what I\u2019m talking about, take a look at this short clip by Gizmodo:Pretty freaking cool. However, Mashable\u2019s Pete Pachal does note that while all the moving around is cool and stuff, when the screens do come together, he could see the seams between the displays which we found pretty disappointing. Then again this is relatively new tech so there are plenty of kinks to work out.Another TV that Samsung had on display showcased the ability for the TV to change its aspect ratios with the modular technology. The display could rotate two sides of the screen to switch it from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 4:3 aspect ratio in seconds. This means you can use up all of those valuable pixels for either of the popular aspect ratios, eliminating those annoying black bars. It\u2019s pretty cool but once again Pete noted that the seam was visible.One final modular TV on display, however, showcased what is realistically the closest to a completed product \u2014 a massive 170\u2033 wall TV that is made up of several smaller panels. Mashable notes that this is perhaps the most practical use of the modular technology, especially since the seams were not visible.Not only does it allow manufacturers to push the TV\u2019s size to even more ridiculous proportions, Mashable notes that it also makes these monstrous TVs easier to ship because movers can break down a huge set to smaller screens.That\u2019s cool and all but we can think of one more way to utilise these modular panels. Assuming they\u2019re easy to remove and hot swap, parents could easily remove a section of the TV to prevent their kids from watching it when they\u2019re being grounded or during their study sessions. In fact, you could probably remove one panel and bring it along with you on holiday to discourage thieves from nicking your precious television. Then again they\u2019d have to have a pretty sizable moving truck to be able to ship a 170\u2033 television in the first place.Either way, as all modular things usually are, the possibilities are almost endless.

While Touch \u2018n Go is gaining momentum in stores, here\u2019s another way to pay without cash.Maybank together with Visa has just announced the PayBand, the first payment wearable in Malaysia. According to Visa, Malaysians are moving towards contactless transactions and they are more likely to shop at a place that accepts one. How it works is somewhat similar to the Maybank\u2019s , which is a sticker that you can stick onto your smartphone.

Think of it as a Touch \u2018n Go in a wristband form and it charges directly to your credit card. In terms of acceptance, it will work with Visa PayWave terminals throughout Malaysia. Just like that PayWave enabled credit card, you would need to wave it in less than 4cm from the terminal to make a payment. This apparently is better than handing over a physical card as there\u2019s no chance for merchants to obtain your full card details.

The video, while it gives us some insight into what the regular version of the device should look like, it doesn\u2019t have any renders of the variants.Awhile back, there was some discussion on whether the S7 launch in February would see four variants (the S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge Plus) of Samsung\u2019s new flagship. We didn\u2019t think so, but new information has surfaced recently about the possibility of a Galaxy S7 Plus and a Galaxy S7 edge Plus being launched.Popular case manufacturer Spigen has put their Samsung Galaxy S7 cases on sale on  even before the device has been launched, though the cases are not on .

While we don\u2019t think that Samsung will be launching the S7 Plus and the S7 edge Plus in February, it also doesn\u2019t make sense for Spigen to have the preorder for those cases so soon if Samsung weren\u2019t going to launch their devices until the end of the year.If they do launch four of them at the same time, the devices could either be separated by region, size or even processor. However, if the devices do get separated by region like  and , we\u2019re sure there will be many unhappy Samsung fans.That said, the images look like placeholder/rendered images because if we were to compare them to @OnLeaks\u2019 (who is quite reputable when it comes to leaks) youtube video, you\u2019d notice that Spigen\u2019s model device is missing the -esque rear curves.As a recap of the specs. both the S7 and the S7 edge are said to run either their latest Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 depending on the market paired with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Good news is that that storage is said to be expandable as leaks claim Samsung is  slot that was missing from their 2015 flagships.Camera wise, the Samsungs are said to have a lower megapixel count, at 12MP for the primary, but feature the Korean manufacturer\u2019s latest BRITECELL camera technology that is said to improve low light photography and reduce the camera hump.

This also works for group chats.\u00a0The only way to access that conversation again is to delete the entire thread and start a new conversation with that contact.That said, if you have 4GB of RAM\u00a0like we did on our Oppo R7s, you can have varying degrees of success in opening the thread again\u00a0though you would have to wait awhile. This vulnerability does not extend to the iOS version of WhatsApp as the emojis only cause the app to lag, unlike a previous \u00a0that relied on a specific message.Although WhatsApp does have a character limit of 6,000 \u2014 to prevent messages that the application cannot handle \u2014 it seems that this still far too many as a mere 5,000 emojis will kill the app.When talking about the potential exploits of having such a vulnerability, Bhuyan says that an attacker could be sending abusive messages to their victim, blackmailing or threatening them, then send them 5,000 emojis to crash that thread and make it so that the victim can\u2019t access the thread for evidence again.Let\u2019s hope WhatsApp (or Facebook) pushes out a fix for this soon before people with bad intentions catch on and start abusing this.[, ]", "id": "125"},
{"text": "If you\u2019ve coveted \u2018s  ever since you saw it first announced way back in early 2015, it looks like you\u2019re in luck, because look what we got in the mail today.Recently released in Taiwan, the ASUS Zenfone Zoom is a pretty interesting device. While smartphone cameras have gotten better with each iteration, one of their flaws have always been a lack of optical zoom.This was because adding an optical zoom would cause your device to be much thicker than a regular smartphone \u2014 a compromise device manufacturers were not willing to make. So, unless one was willing to manually zoom with one\u2019s feet, smartphone photographers often had to settle for a grainier picture if they wanted to zoom.With the Zenfone Zoom, however, ASUS is claiming that this is the thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone\u2026in the world. They accomplished this by mounting the smartphone camera\u2019s dual periscope horizontally across the back of the device. As a result, it boasts a 5mm \u201cultra-thin edge\u201d thanks to an ergonomic curve that looks a lot like ASUS\u2019s other Zenfones.The primary camera itself, while only sporting 13-megapixels, comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus, a dual-tone LED flash and a SmartFSI Panasonic sensor.\u00a0To make up for the lack in resolution, ASUS has implemented a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for greater clarity (up to 52MP). It also has ASUS\u2019s PixelMaster 2.0 \u2014 a feature famed for its low-light performance.To facilitate the impressive camera specifications, the Zenfone Zoom will have not only have a dedicated shutter button, it also has a dedicated video button.It\u2019s no slouch when it comes to performance either, sporting a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom CPU paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB/128GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). The phone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box with ASUS\u2019s ZenUI skin on top.At the front, this camera-centric smartphone features a 5.5\u2033 full-HD display tucked under Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass 4. It also has a metal finish along the rails of the phone to give it a more premium feel. Around the back, there seems to be some differences compared to the one , as that one had some kind of textured back (faux leather perhaps?).However, this could be because the images in the Malaysian site are outdated. If you head on over to the \u00a0you can see that the build more closely resembles the one released in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we will find out how it looks like in about a week\u2019s time.The Zenfone Zoom will sport a 3,000 mAh capacity battery, paired with ASUS\u2019s BoostMaster technology. It is supposed to give you a 60% charge in 39 minutes. Although the Zenfone Zoom has support for up to 802.11ac WiFi, it only has one micro-SIM slot for mobile connectivity.In the US, the Zenfone Zoom comes in at around USD399, which translates to about RM1,760. Considering the state of the ringgit, an optimistic estimate of the Zenfone Zoom\u2019s price here in Malaysia would be RM1,799, but realistically we should probably see it closer to RM1,899.While we\u2019re pretty stoked about the device, we want to know what you guys think.

{"text": "The problem with getting started on a DSLR is that you have to fork out a tonne of cash to be able to afford a decent body plus a lens. Sure some of you might say that you\u2019re OK with the kit lens, but let\u2019s face it, we all want a red band around our lens. Unless you\u2019re not using a Canon device.A startup called Light is trying to change that with their L16 camera \u2014 a camera that has 16 lenses packed into a body\u00a0small enough to fit in your pocket.Well, sort of.\u00a0By Mashable\u2019s estimate, the camera is about the size of three iPhone 6 Pluses stacked together. It probably won\u2019t fit in your skinny jeans then. Nevertheless, it is still an impressive feat that they managed to cram that much tech and that many lenses into a body so small. Oh, did we mention it\u2019s powered by a Snapdragon 820 SoC?On the hardware side of things, this camera has 16 (5x35mm, 5x70mm, 6x150mm) different prime lenses that work together to take an image. The camera sets it up in a way that \u2014 depending on your zoom and framing \u2014 10 lenses will fire at the same time, taking different quadrants of an image. Note that Mashable says the device has 120mm lenses instead of 150mm lenses, but from the company\u2019s video and several other sites, they say that it uses 150mm lenses.The camera then stitches the 10 images together to form a high 52-megapixel image that is should eliminate quality loss normally experienced at the fringes of a lens. These lenses don\u2019t use any kind of fancy glass, instead, they all use f/2.4 P5 plastic lenses coupled with smartphone camera sensors. Plus, since it uses so many lenses at so many different focal lengths, Light claims that the camera has a near infinite depth of field \u2014 something you can adjust in post processing.Sporting a 5\u2033 touchscreen paired with a Snapdragon 820 SoC and an interface based off of Android M, this device looks to bring camera and smartphone imaging technology closer together. Don\u2019t be fooled, this doesn\u2019t have a cellular modem so you can\u2019t make phone calls.A best of both worlds then? We certainly hope so.News of this little guy has been floating around for quite awhile now but recently Mashable got to take a look at one of the prototypes for the device. According to them, the photo stitching on the prototype took a little while to process (it ultimately froze), with the company stating that they\u2019re trying to get the image stitching and processing down to below 1 minute. A pretty ridiculous waiting time for a photo if you ask me.The silver lining is that the processing time is only for the 52-megapixel image, so if you want to post a quick snap on social media, the camera will generate a lower quality image for you. My nose is wrinkling in annoyance.According to Mashable, when Light compared the images between an , Canon 5D Mark III and the Light L16, they were impressed with how detailed the L16 images were but noted that there was a lot of image noise. Battery life on the other hand, Mashable says that the company ballparks it at about 400 shots.While this is a noble attempt at killing our tried and tested DSLR cameras, it seems like it is still a long way off from actually dealing the final blow. Even if the software is perfected and the device works wonderfully, we (like Mashable) believe that the DSLR will continue to live on and be the primary tool for professional photographers.For events and on-the-go photography though, we can see how this device can be very useful for the professionals thanks to it\u2019s portability and, hopefully, stellar image quality. We will have to see how it stacks up against other compact monsters like the Sony RX100 series before jumping to a conclusion though.That said, if this device works out, it could be a great (and much cheaper, coming in at USD1,699 which is around RM7452) alternative to the DSLR for hobbyists and prosumers. Exciting stuff then![, , ]", "id": "129"},

So they are removing a name but the entity will continue to tinker away under a division of Lenovo.One has to have a sense of humour to appreciate the different stances that took place but for once we think Lenovo and Motorola have finally sorts out their branding issues or so we hope.Back in August,  was what Lenovo decided to do as reported by Android Authority. A slight U-turn of decisions by our records but we guess it\u2019s not easy running a\u00a0company as large as Lenovo and they\u2019re bound to make some wrong turns along the way.At least following their statements today we can conclude that brand name-wise, Motorola will cease to exist.

Well, there has been a new development in the matter as TM have decided to postpone their defaulting to the e-Bill format by six months.Towards the end of last year, TM broadband subscribers (Streamyx and UniFi) exploded in outrage when they found out that TM was planning to charge them an exorbitant amount for their printed bills. The\u00a0ISP justified their actions by claiming that it was part of their move to go green \u2014 cutting down and eliminating the usage of paper.As a form of \u2018motivation\u2019 to get customers to\u00a0switch to e-Billing, the telecommunications company was going to incur a monthly charge of RM2 for those who still want to receive their bill in paper format.

Now, there is finally a very official document detailing TM\u2019s plans.According to the release, TM is postponing the defaulting of billing to the e-billing system to 1 July 2016 \u2014 seven months after the original intended implementation date of January 2016. This means that customers can still continue to receive their printed bill for now, but are strongly encouraged to make the switch as soon as possible.Customers who fail to make the switch by 1 July 2016 will continue to receive their printed bill but be incurred a surcharge of RM2 per month. TM is calling on all their subscribers to make the switch as soon as possible if they don\u2019t want to be forced to pay more.They highlight that there are many benefits to using the e-billing system, from speed (customers can receive their\u00a0bills within 4 days) to SMS alerts and even the ability to check your bill online (up to 6 months) from anywhere at any time by simply logging on to this .To do so, simply update your preferred email address and mobile number by sending an email to help@tm.com.my or visit the nearest TMpoint outlet, or call TM Contact Centre at 100 from your landline. According to TM, over 700,000 out of more than 4.4 million TM residential customers are already on the e-Bill statements.

{"text": "just\u00a0dropped a video for their new Reco Smart camera that is designed to not only work as a dash cam\u00a0but also as a portable camera. \u00a0With a fast lens, Sony sensor and an interesting design, things are looking pretty good for it.The Reco Smart camera is shaped a lot like a regular camera lens, without the body, which means that it is also quite large, much like \u2018s QX Camera. With that extra real estate though, ASUS can fit a large (and fast) f/1.8 aperture lens which should let it perform well in low-light conditions.ASUS\u2019s camera also has a \u2018Parking monitor mode\u2019 that lets the camera detect movement in front of your vehicle and automatically start recording until it detects no further movement for one minute. Coupled with a 150-degree wide-angle lens, this Reco Smart cam is shaping up to be a pretty good dash-cam.In the event of a collision, the built-in three-axis G-sensor triggers the emergency record function. It will then save the recording to the ASUS WebStorage cloud and lock it down so it won\u2019t be deleted by accident. Besides that, the camera can also be programmed to send out an emergency text message to a designated contact.Although there is no mention of the sensor\u2019s megapixel count, the camera supports full-HD 1080p video recording as well as real-time previews and downloads on smart devices via the Reco app. Pairing with your smart device should also be a breeze with NFC One Touch Engage. As the device is WiFi capable (802.11 b/g/n), you also get 500GB of ASUS WebStorage cloud storage for free for one year.When ASUS said that the device could also function as a portable camera, they weren\u2019t kidding because from the looks of things, the Reco Camera is compatible with a wide range of standard camera accessories. Stuff like tripods, monopods and even lens filters (which work with 58mm diameter lenses) should fit with no problems.The only bummer is that the device comes with a tiny 720mAh battery that can only support up to one hour of 1080p video recording with the WiFi turned on. As a comparison, a  Hero4 usually averages 1.5 hours of battery life at 1080p recording.You do get a decent amount of kit in the package though, including a microSD card, car charger, dual USB car charger, GPS mount holder and more.

But while most of those devices existed as individual elements, none were truly unified.At least, that\u2019s what HTC and Under Armour said when they launched their\u00a0brand new \u2018fitness system\u2019 that costs USD400 (around RM1751).You must be thinking, you\u2019d get a lot of gear right? Well, that depends on your definition of \u2018a lot\u2019. What we do know is that with the UA HealthBox, you will be receiving three devices \u2014 a fitness band, a smart scale and a heart-rate monitor.Dubbed the UA Band, this fitness band is designed to be worn all-day every day because it tracks daily activities, workout and sleep. Under the band\u2019s \u201cseamless exterior shell\u201d is a display which is \u201cdiscreetly hidden\u201d allowing it to disappear when not in use. While we don\u2019t know how hidden they wanted the screen to be, from the pictures (even their product shots) it certainly looks like it\u2019s well hidden enough to be a nightmare to view under sunlight.The UA Band also features an advanced workout mode with a display that stays on during the workout as well as an LED that indicates heart rate zone when paired with the heart rate monitor. Wow, a screen that stays on!Next, we have the UA Heart Rate \u2014 a compact heart rate monitor that is designed to be undetectable during workouts. It is also supposed to help individuals monitor intensity and train smarter while providing an accurate calculation of calories burned. How refreshing, a heart rate monitor that actually does all this accurately!Finally, we have the UA Scale. It\u2019s a smart scale that is \u201cbeautifully crafted\u201d and WiFi enabled in an \u201ciconic circular design\u201d. This scale also has a hidden LED display that makes the technology invisible when not in use. It also looks like there is a \u201cnifty\u201d feature where they show you a bunch of logos, greet you and only after they\u2019ve done all that do they show you your weight.

{"text": "Last year was a rough time for Qualcomm as it faced criticisms over its top of the line  processor. The newer Snapdragon 820 processor aims to turn things around while bringing its performance up to the mark. At CES 2016, Qualcomm had announced China\u2019s LeTV Le Max Pro as the first smartphone to use their SoC. Apart from having top end performance, the Le Max Pro is also the first device to feature Qualcomm\u2019s  and the first to support multi-gigabit 802.11ad WiFi, which is also known as WiGig.  The LeTV Le Max Pro is a large 6.33\u2033 phablet that pushes Quad HD resolution. Under the hood lies a Snapdragon 820 processor with quad Kyro cores at 2.2GHz that\u2019s mated to 4GB of RAM. The processor claims to be more efficient with a 16nm process and it is accompanied by a Adreno 530 GPU. The new processor with quad-cores apparently provides 2X the performance of an Octa-Core based Snapdragon 810 unit. The Sense ID is supposedly a more advanced biometric feature as it uses ultrasonic sound waves that\u2019s superior than capacitive based scanners commonly used today. Instead of recording an image of your fingertips, Sense ID scans deeper below the skin. As a result, it harder to spoof and it works well even with contaminated fingers. Another advantage is that it works underneath glass, plastics and metal materials, allowing manufacturers to implement the sensor discreetly on smartphones. In terms of design, it looks like a Huawei/honor device with a familiar antenna band stripes from an iPhone. Strangely there\u2019s still a visible fingerprint scanner at the back which could have been omitted with Sense ID. The rear camera is said to be a 21MP shooter with Optical Image Stabilisation and powering this phablet is a generous 3,400mAh battery.

There is also an ultrasound camera mounted at the bottom of the drone that helps it land autonomously.Well, more like crash autonomously if we\u2019re looking at the teaser footage.Like the Bebop 2, you can control the Disco with Parrot\u2019s Skycontroller or plot a flight plan and have the drone do the flying itself. The drone also has a \u201creturn home\u201d function that does exactly what the name suggests.Mounted at the front is the same eye-like 14-megapixel fisheye lens camera Parrot mounts on the Bebop 2, so it will likely feature the same digital panning and stability options as well.While ditching the quadcopter design lets you fly more realistically (especially with FPV goggles), there will inevitably be drawbacks. The drone, for example, loses its ability to hover and takeoff vertically, making it less ideal for filming. It will also inevitably be less stable and manoeuvrable than a quadcopter.Upside? Y0u can fly, turn and pitch like an actual plane. COOL.Despite their claims, The Verge points out that Parrot aren\u2019t the first to introduce a\u00a0ready-to-fly fixed-wing drone as there are already several small fixed-wing drones in the market.Though we do think the Disco is one of the best looking fixed-wing drones out there. Or almost out there, since it\u2019s still a prototype. Parrot does plan to make this available to consumers within this year so that\u2019s something to look forward to.[]", "id": "140"},

{"text": "has finally launched a successor to their wildly popular K3 Note, the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note, which looks like it is more than worthy to fill the K3 Note\u2019s big shoes.Alongside several interesting features, Lenovo will also be bundling its midrange device with a virtual reality (VR) headset.The Vibe K4 Note\u2019s specifications look good on paper, with it sporting a 5.5-inch full-HD (1920\u00d71080 pixels) IPS panel, which results in a pixel density of 401ppi. The display, which the company claims has a 1000:1 contrast ratio with adjustable colour balance, will be tucked under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3.On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC paired with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. For optics, the device will see a 13MP rear shooter with PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) and a fast f/2.2 aperture. Helping the device out with low-light shots is a two-tone LED flash to the right of the camera module. For selfies, the phone\u00a0unsurprisingly sports a 5MP front-facing camera.What is surprising is the fact that the device will feature a pair of front-facing stereo Dolby Atmos speakers, something that\u2019s missing even on most flagship devices. What\u2019s more, this mid-range device also sports a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back just below the primary camera (my personal favourite location), something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market.Powering everything will be a quick charge enabled 3,300 mAh battery that is supposed to deliver 265 hours of 3G standby time and 22 hours of 3G talk time. The device also comes with dual-SIM support, both of which have support for 4G LTE. The device will run Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo\u2019s Vibe UI skin on top, though we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update in the near future.The reason they bundled the smartphone with a VR headset is so that users can take advantage of Lenovo\u2019s TheaterMax technology which converts regular content into immersive VR content. While we don\u2019t know how \u201cimmersive\u201d TheaterMax will end up being, Lenovo seems pretty confident in it, leaving the final judgement to time itself.Lenovo\u2019s mid-ranger will go on a flash sale on Amazon India on January 19 at\u00a0INR11,999 (around RM783) for just the device, while the VR bundle will cost INR13,299 (around RM868).

{"text": "Samsung is expected to launch its new  next month during . As we inch closer towards its launch day, serial leakster,  has dropped more details on Samsung\u2019s next big duo. The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge had opened a new chapter for Samsung with its premium glass and metal design, along with top specs that hold well to this very day. Of course, there are many that frown upon its compromises. It was their first flagship to not have a removable battery and most critical of all, it lacks an expandable microSD slot. If you were disappointed by the Galaxy S6, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to on the upcoming model.According to @evleaks, the new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will finally offer a microSD slot. Like the current S6, both models will be offered with either 32GB and 64GB storage options, which in Malaysia we are likely to receive the smallest option of just 32GB. This would be good news for those taking loads of pictures and 4K videos as the device is alleged to support microSD cards up to 200GB. This reaffirms an earlier \u201c\u201d that Samsung is finally bringing back the microSD slot to its latest flagship. With each new model, the Galaxy S lineup has always seen an increase of battery capacities. However on the Galaxy S6, it was downsized from 2,800mAh on the Galaxy S5 to just 2,550mAh (2,600mAh on the S6 edge). Fortunately, the new processor and energy efficient  were good at maximising every mAh of power. The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are alleged to receive 3,000mAh and 3,600mAh capacity batteries respectively, which is a huge jump. That\u2019s like fitting a Galaxy Note battery into a smaller device, and hopefully this could translate to more than 24 hours of usage. Wireless Charging will still be the star of the show and Samsung will likely to support fast wireless charging for the new flagship duo as it did with the Galaxy Note5. Charging an S7 is reported to take about 2 hours wirelessly while the S7 edge will take slightly longer at 2.2 hours.  First introduced on the Galaxy S5, the S7 is said to be getting water and dust resistance with an IP67 rating. This is similar with the Galaxy S5 which in theory can be submerged up to 1 metre for up to 30 minutes. Even if you don\u2019t go to the pool, having water resistance is a good feature to have especially for those unexpected moments. Even word has it that the folks at Cupertino  to make its upcoming iPhone waterproof. If Samsung is doing it, it better be a cap-less design without those clumsy flap covers. The Galaxy S7/S7 edge will be running on their latest Exynos 8890 processor but there will be a Qualcomm-powered version for selected markets that runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor. Expect them to come with 4GB of RAM and has support for faster Cat 9 4G LTE. In terms of screen size, the standard S7 is likely to retain the same compact 5.1\u2033 Quad HD display while the S7 edge is rumoured to be either a larger 5.5 or 5.7 incher. To have a 5.7\u2033 smartphone at this time of the year  as it would cannibalise its own S6 edge+ that was launched not too long ago.Camera wise, the new flagships will get a smaller pixel count of 12MP instead of its current 16MP shooter. However, it is compensated with faster f/1.7 lens versus f/1.9 for better low-light performance. With a smaller BRITECELL camera module, the new S7 could have a flat and flush back design without the protruding camera hump.  Are you excited now?

Are you surprised?We weren\u2019t. Right now, there is simply no alternative to Facebook and what the social media platform offers, so it seems only natural that users would find any means possible to access the site.

The experiment was so controversial that even the editor behind the study was \u201c\u201c, questioning if the results of the study were actually worth all the backlash.What most people don\u2019t realise \u2014 or choose to turn a blind eye on \u2014 is that social experimenting on the Internet is nothing new.

It is an interesting safety feature as it disconnects if someone tripped over your cable, avoiding the risk of dragging your laptop to the ground. When Apple introduced the new , it was ditched in favour of the all-new USB Type-C. This is supposedly the future standard of connectivity, allowing you to deliver power, data and even high-resolution video on a single cable. Sadly that means you\u2019re stuck with an old-school cable design like other gadgets. If you want to restore that MagSafe feature of old, cable maker Griffin finally has a solution for you.Simply called as BreakSafe, the new magnetic USB cable works essentially like the MagSafe that came as standard with previous MacBook models. It is fairly easy to release and it will automatically disconnect when there\u2019s excessive pressure. On one end, you get a fixed USB Type-C connector that goes into your power adapter, while the other end has two pieces, with the small stub that stays permanently in your MacBook port. The cable is 6 feet (1.8 metres) long and the magnetic connector is about 12.8mm deep. On their , it is listed as coming soon with the retail price tag of US$39.99 (about RM173).

Despite its political and regulatory hurdles, Uber has been growing quite rapidly covering hundreds of cities in 68 countries worldwide.

While there have been rumours going around about a potential Samsung Galaxy S7+, SamMobile believes that this will likely be the S7 edge instead.We highly doubt Samsung would cannibalise their popular recent flagship and risk their consumers getting pissed at them, just so they can be \u201cradical\u201d.

According to the picture, the S7 (or S7 edge or S7+) looks to feature a 12.2-megapixel rear camera coupled with a 5-megapixel front shooter.What\u2019s interesting is the drastic drop in megapixel count for the rear camera, down from 16MP, in a 2016 device. This is in-line with an earlier rumour that the device would sport a 12MP large pixel sensor, though it doesn\u2019t match Samsung\u2019s .At their Investor\u2019s Forum last year, Samsung unveiled the BRITECELL camera technology, which utilises tiny one micron pixels which are \u201cthe smallest pixel for slim smartphone\u201d. If Samsung were to use these small pixels and also drop pixel count, then they would really have to have something up their sleeve to help the sensor cope with low-light photography.The image also reveals that the device will have a Snapdragon 820 processor with an Adreno 530 GPU mated with 4GB of RAM, which is, unsurprising.In any case, these are only rumours and Samsung could just be pulling a fast one, using multiple prototypes to mislead leaksters.

With everything going up, the fares will be  to RM55/way effective 1st January 2016. That\u2019s a hefty RM110 for two people heading to the airport. Is there a cheaper alternative? What if we tell you there\u2019s another way of getting there with zero emission and it costs less than an  ride?COMOS, a ride-sharing provider that uses 100% electric vehicles has introduced an Airport Valet Service. For a flat rate of RM70, you can head to KLIA or KLIA2 in an electric-powered . The service comes with a designated COMOS staff, so you can hop-on and hop-off without worrying about parking. Do note that the Renault Zoe is a compact hatchback, so the boot isn\u2019t as spacious as a typical sedan car. The COMOS Airport Valet service would cost you RM70 which is inclusive of GST, toll and delivery charges to your location. So that equates to RM35/person for a trip for two or RM23.34/person for 3 pax. On the downside, it is only available from 9:00AM to 4:00PM, and it covers just the following areas in the Klang Valley. If you haven\u2019t tried COMOS before, the first step of getting a key card would take a while. You would need to  for a membership which now costs RM50 for 1 year (Normal: RM300). Once that\u2019s done, you can collect your COMOS card and start booking as follows:You are advised to request the service at least 2 hours ahead of the intended time and it is subject to actual availability of cars. You may book for the next day but the option is only available after 10:00PM. This is a cashless service and the final amount will be charged to your registered credit card. You can read up more about the service .COMOS was introduced as an alternative means to car ownership. Being a ride-sharing service, you only pay for membership and usage fees according to your usage. At the moment, the rental costs RM6 for 15 minutes with a minimum booking of 30 minutes (RM12). For an all day usage, it will cost you a flat rate of RM144. With its fleet of electric cars, there\u2019s no fuel cost involved so you won\u2019t need to return the car with a full tank. There are several COMOS pick up stations located around PJ and KL with more being planned out in the near future. Currently all bookings are done via its website on  and soon they will be releasing a mobile app for iOS and Android.We\u2019ve tried COMOS a couple of times and it is quite an experience driving a quiet vehicle that hums like a spaceship. Since it\u2019s new, the number of stations with charging points are quite limited. It isn\u2019t really that cost efficient for simple point to point trips since you\u2019re required to return the vehicle to its limited pickup/drop off points. If you\u2019re making a stop, you would still need to pay for parking, which defeats the purpose of saving time and money. This would probably make more sense once they have more stations around strategic points including shopping malls and office complexes. If COMOS isn\u2019t viable due to timing and location, Uber is  a flat rate of RM75 (excluding tolls) to KLIA/KLIA2. There\u2019s no promo code required, and you can request anytime from now until 5th January 2016.

{"text": "Think about a printed image of a sprawling cityscape. Can you confidently tell how far\u00a0apart one building is from the next and navigate it without a proper scale? What about those little parts that are obscured by a building or a shadow? Can you tell what\u2019s hidden there?Now imagine all of that detail compressed into the body of a baby girl and you\u2019ve only begun to scrape the surface of how difficult surgeon Dr Redmond Burke\u2019s operation was.Teegan Lexcen, a 4-month-old baby was admitted into the Niklaus Children\u2019s Hospital in Miami, Florida because she was born with a misplaced heart. Without surgery, she would be dead by Christmas.The worst part? Doctors\u00a0couldn\u2019t see a way in to operate.I don\u2019t think I need to tell you how delicate heart surgery is, or how difficult it can be. It becomes nigh impossible when you don\u2019t have all the information you need.Burke says that surgeons need to be able to visualise the entire procedure before they step into the operating room, which is why many surgical teams passed on Teegan\u2019s operation because they kept running into walls during this process: It seemed inoperable.Burke had the same problem as he had no way of knowing if a standard incision over the sternum would be enough, but \u201cinoperable\u201d was not a word he enjoyed using. Exhausting medical solutions, the team began looking for creative solutions and one particularly enterprising member uploaded the scans of Teegan\u2019s chest to , converting them into 3D stereoscopic imagines, which allowed them to view it in VR.Virtual Reality. That was the answer. Burke said that with  and a smartphone he was able to see the patient\u2019s entire heart by simply tilting his head. He could turn it and manipulate it as if he was already in the operating room.From there, Burke could see Teegan\u2019s heart as well as her chest wall and with that information, he knew that a standard incision would indeed be fine.According to Burke, this solution came just in the nick of time; any longer and her kidneys may have suffered too much from her being put under. She would be alive, but on dialysis for the rest of her days.We\u2019re floored that a little bit of cardboard and a smartphone actually saved someone\u2019s life. That and good old fashioned human ingenuity of course.Burke views every operation as possible and it was down to whether the doctor had the confidence to perform it or not. With VR he could visualise the steps in his head and help him come up with a plan of operation for his team which allowed him to save his patient.Seven hours later, little Teegan was all patched up and ready for Christmas and ho, ho, ho-pefully\u00a0for many more Christmases to come.[, ]", "id": "166"},

{"text": "They say a king is nothing without his people. A tree, nothing, without its roots. A product, nothing, without its consumers. So what happens\u00a0when a smartphone manufacturer gets slapped with a class action lawsuit filed by the very people who used to preach their excellence?Draaaama!More than a hundred infuriated  owners have filed a lawsuit against , claiming USD5 million (around RM21.5 million) in damages, accusing them of significantly slowing down their devices with the new  9 update. The lawsuit was filed with a New York district court, though no hearings have been set at this time.According to plaintiff Chiam Lerman and several others, the new update slowed the device down so much that it interfered with day-to-day usage.It seems that after upgrading, both first and third-party applications exhibited delayed launch times, slow response to touchscreen input and other problems. Overall performance was also affected by freezes and crash events.They also accuse Apple of engaging in deceptive trade practices and false advertising by proclaiming that the update is compatible with legacy smartphones dating back to the iPhone 4s models. The lawsuit also claims that Apple were well aware of iOS 9\u2019s negative impacts on the iPhone 4s but went ahead with the marketing campaign anyway.The campaign advertised faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life among other enticing features. To make matters worse, the company\u2019s advertisements, website, and iOS page did not have any warning of potential compatibility issues for older devices.Apparently the complaint went after Apple\u2019s iOS system itself, because when faced with a sluggish and slow device, it is more likely that the average Apple user would upgrade to a new iOS product instead of branching out. The reason being that transferring information across devices within the same ecosystem is much easier. Plus there is also the familiarity factor.It isn\u2019t too surprising that a new iOS update would slow down older devices because each new update is designed to take advantage of the hardware from the recent models. This includes a host of new features and improvements that an older device may not have even dreamt was possible, much less have support for it.Apple has been in this situation before, back in 2011, where plaintiffs\u00a0complained that iOS 4 turned their iPhone 3G into \u201ciBricks\u201d. That case was tossed out a year later and it seems likely that this lawsuit will suffer the same fate.One of the main arguments in the iOS vs Android war was that Apple always pushed new updates, even to old devices such as the iPhone 4s while Android devices have a realistic lifespan of 2 years. After 2 years, it is very unlikely that your Android device would be getting any updates from its manufacturer.Apple fans argued that this was because Android was so fragmented, with so many different manufacturers making so many different versions of the Android OS. iOS isn\u2019t the same because everything was unified under one banner.That said, there is an exception to this  dilemma: The  devices. Nexus smartphones tend to receive OS updates much quicker and for longer than most other devices. But unlike what\u2019s happening to these unfortunate iPhone 4s users, each Android update usually improves the performance of older devices due to improved optimisation\u00a0of the OS.This brings Apple users to what looks like a difficult decision. Do you update your OS to get new features and better security at the risk of sluggish performance? Or do you stick to what already works and brave potential security risks? Let us know in the comments below.If you\u2019re as frustrated as these users and think Apple does this on purpose so that people will be forced to buy a new iPhone, don\u2019t hesitate to drop your opinion in the comment box too![, ]", "id": "170"},

And while we understand that most people out there won\u2019t have the technology to view 4K content, we decided that choosing the highest recording resolution for all four devices would be the fairest gauge.\u00a0Duking it out will be:A slow but steady advancement of camera technology has us finding that most flagship\u00a0smartphones are now capable of being the only device\u00a0we\u2019d use to take images and video, rendering point and shoots somewhat obsolete.

That said, a professional photographer could definitely take better photos than someone that has little/no knowledge on the matter. Of course, when using a smartphone, you don\u2019t necessarily have to be knowledgeable in photography to begin with but have you seen those campaigns dedicated to showing off what these smartphone cameras are capable of?Apple has been running a  to show-off what the iPhones can do.

{"text": "MORE HORSEPOWER. That\u2019s usually a buyer\u2019s biggest criteria when looking for a smartphone. It\u2019s also what people look for when determining the value-for-money aspect of a device, as consumers will try their best to squeeze every bit of horsepower for as low of a price as possible.It is these buyers that were ultimately disappointed when  launched the  because it had decidedly mediocre specs for a not-low-at-all asking price of USD400. In a world where smartphone manufacturers are churning out devices with incredible specs for an equally incredible low price, this is simply unacceptable. Thankfully, HTC\u2019s new \u201chero\u201d device seems to rectify this problem, to some extent at least.Rumours have been floating around for awhile now about HTC\u2019s new . Early leaks suggested that it could run the\u00a0, which reignited the fire within the hearts of many an HTC fan. However, as time progressed, the rumours changed and on paper it looked like the One X9 .Well, the device has finally come out from the shadows and at first glance, it definitely doesn\u2019t look like the flagship device everyone was clamouring for. Then again, since this was launched this year, were we realistically expecting it to outperform the  especially since it doesn\u2019t even bear the M badge?The One X9 sports a 5.5\u2033 1080p panel (though there doesn\u2019t seem to be any information on whether it will be an AMOLED or IPS screen) which results in a pixel density of 401 ppi\u00a0that HTC claims has a 170-degree viewing angle. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal storage. Thankfully, HTC has included a microSD slot that allows expansion up to 2TB.It will also feature a reasonably large 3,000 mAh battery and support for dual-SIM. Optics-wise, the device sports a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with optical image stabilisation and 4K video recording, plus a 5MP f/2.8 front-facing shooter. It is likely that the device will come pre-loaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, much like the HTC One A9.Although the specs are nothing to shout about, the device does bring back HTC\u2019s much-loved BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers, something that is missing from it\u2019s smaller brother, the One A9. HTC also went further down \u201cnostalgia alley\u201d, bringing back their backlit capacitive keys, which is placed where the HTC logo usually goes. One aspect that will be missed is the absence of a fingerprint sensor, something that is available on the HTC One A9.Another serving of good news is that the metallic smartphone looks to retail at a lower price than the One A9, coming in at 2,399 Yuan, which translates to around RM1,598. Yes, if you did pick up on it, the retail price is in CNY which means that this device \u2014 as of now \u2014 has only been launched in China with no information about availability elsewhere. This device, it seems, represents HTC\u2019s stab at trying to get a bigger cut of the affordable premium smartphone market by competing with other Chinese manufacturers on their home soil.If you think horsepower is the be all and end all of smartphones, then this HTC One X9 will look like another disappointing HTC \u201chero\u201d device that could have been so much more. It isn\u2019t the best value-for-money device out there, but is a device\u2019s worth measured only by how well it does on benchmarks? Sure, 4GB of RAM looks good on paper, but can you realistically feel the difference between 4GB and 3GB of RAM?Fit and finish has always been one of HTC\u2019s strongest selling points. That and their front-facing speakers, both of which can be found on One X9. It honestly doesn\u2019t look too bad either \u2014 except for that slightly sketchy camera visor \u2014 and based on the company\u2019s track record, they certainly know how to do metal unibodies. The device\u2019s closest competitor would probably be the Sony Xperia M5 Dual, and based on build alone, we definitely prefer a metal finish to the Xperia M5 Dual\u2019s fingerprint-magnet glass-plastic construction.With proper optimisation, these specs should get you through day-to-day usage without a hitch and for a frankly reasonable price tag, this doesn\u2019t seem like that bad a deal for HTC fans. Yeah, sure, you won\u2019t be able to brag about it to your friends but then again, there aren\u2019t that many brag-worthy HTC devices to begin with. With HTC\u2019s flagships only managing to\u00a0stay afloat as well as the Titanic could, perhaps the midrange premium market\u00a0is where they can reclaim some of their former glory.[, , ]", "id": "174"},

Then again, it isn\u2019t uncommon for manufacturers to configure the device differently when running benchmarks.In any case,\u00a0it looks like there could be a monstrous Windows Phone (likely running Windows 10 Mobile) set to be released sometime next year.\u00a0In fact, a new report out of  claims that the device could see an official unveiling at the upcoming  (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona next February.However, the report also notes that HP has yet to give the project the final go-ahead. With specs that exceed even Microsoft\u2019s own Windows flagship devices (plus it could be cheaper), could this be the Windows Phone messiah fans have been waiting for?We doubt it. Especially if Windows 10 Mobile doesn\u2019t receive the updates it needs in time. Though we haven\u2019t spent time with the Lumia flagships, reports and reviews point to a worrying trend of incomplete (plus buggy) software, similar to that on the Surface line of 2-in-1 devices.Reviewers have noted some minor problems such as 4K video recording not working properly to big problems like the home screen disappearing entirely after an app crashes \u2014 something that happens quite often apparently \u2014 which shouldn\u2019t happen in a completed product. If these problems lie with Windows 10 Mobile, then all the hardware in the world won\u2019t be able to save the experience.It is admirable that it seems like HP wants to show Microsoft how to really build a Windows 10 Mobile flagship, but unless Redmond steps up its own game, the new device will likely not amount to anything.

OK, it\u2019s quite useless actually since you can do practically everything on your Android smartphone anyway.So maybe , despite how incomplete and frustrating it is, is the way to go.  certainly thinks so since what looks like their latest 12-inch Windows 10 tablet was just certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG.Rumours that Samsung were working on a 12\u2033 Windows 10 tablet have been floating around for quite some time now but this is the first piece of solid confirmation that this device is indeed in the pipeline. According to SamMobile Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG certifications are usually a good indicator that the device is on the way to the shelves soon.The 12-inch unit bearing the model number SM-W700 is said to feature a screen resolution of either 2560\u00d71600 or 3840\u00d72400. On the inside, the device will allegedly be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM.Some have said that the tablet may also come with an S Pen which, coupled with the full Windows 10 experience, could certainly improve productivity. If Samsung adds a keyboard accessory then we may have another Surface/iPad Pro challenger on our hands.As Android phones continue to get bigger, the equivalent OS tablet is becoming less and less relevant because people can already do so much on their phone. Front facing speakers plus a 5.7\u2033 Smartphone can provide just as much immersion (if not more) as a side/rear speakered\u00a07.9-inch tablet.It\u2019s just not worth carrying an extra device just so you have a slightly bigger screen. Keep in mind bigger, in this sense, doesn\u2019t always mean better as in general smartphones have a better pixel density than tablets and a better pixel density usually equals a better viewing experience.Let me put it this way, spreading a single cup of waffle batter over a baking tray the size of your palm would get you a thicker, fluffier, and more satisfying waffle versus spreading the same amount over a tray the size of a dining table.The same concept applies to screens. If you spread 1080p over a 5.7\u2033 display, you\u2019re bound to get a better screen than if it was spread over 12-inches of real estate.So if media consumption is not the best, productivity has to be the tablet\u2019s redeeming factor, and in that Windows 10 beats Android hands down. Considering how wonky Windows 10 is, that\u2019s saying quite a lot about how unoptimised Android is for the big screen.The Korean electronics giant isn\u2019t the only one launching a Windows 10 tablet though as Xiaomi has just  in both Android and Windows 10.

The name suggests that this smartphone would be a downgrade from the the Liquid Z630, but it also shares its bigger brother\u2019s internal hardware as well as camera optics. That\u2019s a pretty good deal for RM559.Acer also has an entry level device in the Liquid Z line, the Liquid , priced at RM439. It comes bundled with a 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM running underneath its 4.5\u201d screen. That should be more than enough for you to get a feel of what the Android experience is all about, making this device the perfect starter smartphone for anyone.All three devices will have blazingly fast dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acer\u2019s Liquid UI running over it. Additionally, these devices will have the Acer Float Apps which essentially allows users to open more than one application and multitask at the same time. Acer also bundles a Float Caller which appears as a mini popup when a call comes in, letting the user decide how to respond without interrupting what they\u2019re doing.Every one of the trio will also have what Acer calls the Quick Mode. The Quick Mode functions to allow users to pick between three customised layout options: Standard Mode (for those familiar with smartphones), Easy Mode (for those just starting out), and Basic Mode (locks down application and usage for kids).There is also a Kids Center application which grants parental control over the device for a safer browsing, viewing and playing environment for your child. These devices also come with Acer\u2019s Bluelightshield which reduces strain on the eyes by reducing the amount of blue light emissions from the display.For more information, head over to .", "id": "187"},

On the current version, EMUI looks awfully similar to Xiaomi\u2019s own interface from the flat icon design, to the minimalistic approach for its built-in apps such as phone dialer, alarm clock, stopwatch, toggle switches and even the menu page. Even the shutdown menu interface that\u2019s displayed after long pressing the power button looks the same as well.

Just when you thought nobody will pull the same trick here in Malaysia, think again.

A 28-year-old victim was reported to be buying 4 phones at RM200 each at Kota Raya Shopping Complex. However after making the payment of RM800, he was told to enter a secluded room where he was locked up for hours. He was then told to pay an exorbitant RM10,000 fee for his release. Eventually, the victim was set free, but not after he withdrawn RM5,000 from an ATM. To rub salt to the wound, the 4 phones which he got was different from what was shown earlier. Obviously, the next thing to do was to report to the relevant authorities. He was said to have complained to several agencies including the Ministry of trade and Consumer Affairs, but no action has been taken. As a last resort, he seeks help from PPIM (Persatuan Pengguna Islam Malaysia) which proceeded to raid the shop. From the operation, it was found that there are a number of phone shops at Kota Raya that are selling counterfeit products at skyrocketed prices. In total, they had managed to cover as much as RM11,900 on behalf of 7 victims. Apart from locals, these shops tend to target foreigners especially women that would often fall prey to such tactics.

Many, ourselves included, felt that Microsoft shipped an unfinished product. From what we gathered, it isn\u2019t the hardware that the Surface users are unhappy about, rather it was the software implementation that let the devices down.What\u2019s worse, Microsoft\u2019s \u201csolution\u201d to the problem was an apology on their forums which only served to irk more users. Now though, they seem to have actually come up with a solution to at least one of their problems.Besides the issues with the device\u2019s power drainage during sleep and random reboots, one other nagging issue was the Surface device\u2019s keyboard and touchpad. The much improved Surface Pro 4 Type Cover keyboard was so advanced, it seemed, that it didn\u2019t deem the Surface Pro 4 a worthy device and thus refused to pair with it properly. The Surface Pro 4 had issues connecting with its keyboard, especially when removing the Type Cover and reattaching it, bugging out the mouse cursors and other modes for Continuum.For us, the problems were more rudimentary when it came to the Surface Pro 4. We found out that if the keyboard was attached when the device was off, it wouldn\u2019t detect the keyboard when we switched it on, forcing us to disengage and reattach the keyboard to the device.This update also affects Surface Book users, where apparently the device had problems with its touchpad and keyboard as well. Here are the\u00a0changelogs:If you were anywhere near as excited as us for the launch of the Surface Pro 4, and dropped a considerable chunk of your savings to get one with the Type Cover keyboard, I\u2019m sure you were equally crestfallen when you discovered that Microsoft already knew the device had issues yet still decided to put it in the market.While doing something like this is, frankly, unforgivable, you\u2019d think that a company as big as Microsoft would have some kind of fix ready almost immediately after it put an unfinished product on sale. Instead, they said that major fixes would .In any case, these problems seem to be software based, and fixable via updates so if you\u2019ve bought a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book device, our advice is to hunker down and weather this initial storm in the hopes that your device will eventually live up to its full potential.If you\u2019re still on the fence about purchasing one, stay tuned to our upcoming review of the Surface Pro 4 where we will be taking a close look at the device, all of its problems, fixes and more.[]", "id": "205"},

The question is, will it change Microsoft\u2019s success in the local market? Let\u2019s see if Digi enterprise/business customers take advantage of this special deal.The smaller of the two, the Lumia 950 will be absolutely free of charge though it\u2019ll come with a hefty monthly fee of RM 238 on a 2 year (24 months) contract \u2013 working out to a huge RM 5,712 total. It isn\u2019t just for the phone, as you\u2019ll be getting 10GBs of mobile data, totally unlimited calls, text and instant messaging (WhatsApp and WeChat).If you\u2019d prefer something bigger and more powerful, the Lumia 950 XL will be available too. You\u2019ll get the same plan as talked about above, at the same monthly price, but you\u2019ll have to fork out an additional RM 330 upfront for the smartphone itself; bringing you to an eventual RM 6,042 total cost.Given that spending RM 238 per month doesn\u2019t sound as practical for someone who doesn\u2019t use all that bundled data, calls/texts and instant messaging, you can bump that price down by choosing other Digi plans that will be announced on the 18th of December; mind you, the two smartphones\u2019 will cost more, but you\u2019ll be paying less monthly.During the same announcement, Digi mentioned that this collaboration will bring about a third (more affordable) device, the Microsoft Lumia 550, that will be free on the Digi SmartPlan 98.

Well,  has the next best thing. Ahead of the official Malaysian premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Google has thrown together an interesting new Chrome web browser experience that lets you wield a lightsaber to fend off First Order Stormtroopers.The Lightsaber Escape game uses a simple mechanism that lets you wield your phone as if it was a lightsaber and slay Stormtroopers on either your laptop or computer in an attempt to escape a space station. Here\u2019s how you play: Simply log on to the Lightsaber Escape \u00a0with your laptop or computer, then enter the URL displayed on the resulting web page into your phone. Once\u00a0there, your phone should begin calibrating its accelerometer and upon completion, turn into the lightsaber it was always meant to be. You can then either play it on your computer\u2019s monitor or cast/hook it up to a projector and have some theater level fun like we did.When you\u2019re calibrated and past the tutorial mission, that\u2019s when the real fun begins. The game takes you on an on-rail action adventure through a space station filled with Stormtroopers who happen to be surprisingly accurate. With your trusty lightsaber equipped, you will engage in ranged combat, where you deflect blaster fire back at your attackers, \u00a0as well as melee combat. We haven\u2019t made it far enough into the game where we\u2019ve encountered a Sith yet, so do let us know in the comments below if you have.It is a fantastic experience we highly recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or otherwise especially since it works on both iOS and Android. We did encounter some input lag in our adventures through the game as well as some drops in framerate but that is kind of expected when playing a browser game. The experience in itself more than makes up for it though, so all is forgiven. Maybe by the next installment of the Star Wars franchise we will be able to play this (or something like this) in virtual reality.[]", "id": "207"},

If you\u2019re asking why there\u2019s such a bridging of the two; it\u2019s mainly due to a merger that\u2019s reported to take place come 2017.The report suggests that heads at Google think combining the two makes the most sense, since Android has had an early start as an operating system for quite some time. And we\u2019re already starting to see small changes that point towards a unification in latest Pixel product.Google\u2019s Pixel branding has been have over the place, of late; partly due to the Pixel C choosing Android over Chrome OS.

It\u2019s the company\u2019s first ever battery pack and it\u2019s decidedly un-Apple. More on that later but first, let\u2019s go into the specs.The Smart Battery Case is a battery pack that fits the  and . It packs a 1,877mAh battery and Apple says it\u2019s good for 18 hours of internet browsing time on LTE or 20 hours of video playback time. The battery case has a soft touch silicone exterior with a microfibre inner lining to protect your iPhone. There are two colours to choose from (white and charcoal gray) currently and it\u2019s the only battery case that comes with a lighting connector.So why is the Smart Battery Case un-Apple?It\u2019s the design.

There\u2019s no separate switch to activate or deactivate the battery case and the lack of an external battery indicator makes it difficult to know how much power you have left without turning on your iPhone.You do however get an integrated battery status built into iOS when the battery case is plugged into your iPhone but that means you will have to turn on your phone every time you want check the power status of the battery case.And for the  asking price, you\u2019re not getting a lot. A popular battery case alternative like the  with a 2,750mAh battery pack, a dedicated on/off switch and external LED indicators costs about the same.So if you\u2019re an iPhone 6 or 6S user that\u2019s constantly looking for a power point because your iPhone is out of battery, you might want to stay away from the Apple Battery Pack.

{"text": "After numerous  and , the  series has finally been revealed. If they keep the pricing in the same bracket as the previous Galaxy A series, we could have a serious contender in the low-to-midrange end of the smartphone market.The Galaxy A series consists of three phones, the , , and  all bearing their new \u201c6\u201d badge that is supposed to represent 2016. We don\u2019t know about you, but this peculiar badging just seems like another way to unnecessarily confuse prospective buyers.At first glance, all three devices share \u2019s  flagship\u2019s looks with a metal body sandwiched between two panels of glass. They also feature the rounded edges of the Galaxy S6 and pretty much the same layout we\u2019ve grown to get used to for Samsung devices. All three devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box.One thing that we were quite impressed with was the camera. All devices across the announced Galaxy A range feature a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture rear shooter and a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates them is that on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 both come bundled with optical image stabilisation (OIS) for their primary imaging unit. That\u2019s pretty impressive for what looks to be mid-range devices. The best part? They all come in Pink Gold, so if you\u2019ve ever wanted that colour but not the price tag it usually comes with, this could be your chance.That aside, the Galaxy A series begins with what looks like the entry-level Galaxy A3 sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280\u00d7720 pixels) Super AMOLED display. The device would be powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz processor mated with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. This smartphone will also come with a 2,300 mAh battery.The Galaxy A3 will also have dual-SIM support, but it doesn\u2019t appear to be a hybrid-SIM set up which means that you can have two SIMs and a microSD card. Other goodies include Cat.4 LTE connectivity support and 802.11 b/g/n WiFi. It also comes with Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, but no support for Samsung Pay.Moving up the pecking order comes the mid-range Galaxy A5. As the name implies, the Galaxy A5 is a step up from the Galaxy A3 and features a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (also expandable via microSD up to 128GB). It is also bigger, with a 5.2\u201d full-HD (1920\u00d71080 pixels) Super AMOLED display. Powering it all will be a 2,900 mAh battery with fast charging.Connectivity options include Cat.6 LTE support, 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, this time with support for Samsung Pay. Perhaps one of the key features of this device is the fingerprint scanner, which is quite rare beyond the top end of the smartphone spectrum. Much like the Galaxy A3, the Galaxy A5 also has dual-SIM support.Sitting at the top of the range is the Galaxy A7, which is the largest device, featuring a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel. Under the hood, the smartphone will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. It also has dual-SIM capabilities.Connectivity options are the same as the Galaxy A5, but the Galaxy A7 gets a bigger 3,300 mAh battery also with fast charging. Like its smaller brother the Galaxy A5, the Galaxy A7 also comes with a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay.Though the specific type of processor was not revealed, we have a hunch that it is Samsung\u2019s Exynos processor. The first range of the Galaxy A smartphones were launched towards the end of 2014 and it was Samsung\u2019s first attempt at truly bringing premium build quality to the masses. Before the Galaxy A series was launched, Samsung\u2019s low end devices were all very plasticky and felt cheaply made, which felt like a rude reminder to all those who bought them to work harder.Now, with the rise of Chinese OEMs and their seemingly impossible smartphone value-for-money, especially in the lower end of the spectrum, the Korean electronics giant can\u2019t afford to be complacent in their budget smartphones and risk giving up this lucrative section in the market.If the refreshed 2016 versions of the Galaxy A lineup are to be priced similarly to the previous Galaxy A lineup, we think that it could definitely be very competitive in that market. However, if Samsung prices these devices higher than their previous lineup, you\u2019d be better off with a discounted Galaxy S6 instead.As a reference, when the original Galaxy A lineup was launched, the Galaxy A3 was priced at RM899, while the Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199, and the Galaxy A7 would set you back RM1,499. Bear in mind, these prices were before the implementation of GST and the falling ringgit. Of course, there are other good smartphones at this price bracket as well, such as the , the  and the .

It isn\u2019t just another reference device but an upmarket one that could very well compete with the current crop of flagship smartphones.After its  in late September, the Nexus 6P is finally here in Malaysia and you can place your orders beginning this Thursday, 10th December.Available in a single 64GB storage variant, the Nexus 6P is priced officially at RM2,698 inclusive of GST. For Malaysia, we are getting two colour options \u2013 Aluminium and Graphite. So far there\u2019s no news of its other Gold and Frost White versions.In terms of size, the Nexus 6P despite its \u201c6\u201d moniker has a 5.7\u2033 screen which makes it more compact than last year\u2019s Nexus 6 by Motorola. The AMOLED screen pushes a Quad HD resolution of 2560\u00d71440 that gives a pixel density of 518 pixels per inch. The exterior is where the Nexus 6P stands out. It gets an all-metal unibody design with a \u201chelmet visor\u201d bump at the back that houses its camera module.Accompanying its high-resolution screen is a pair of stereo speakers which is perfect for gaming and audio playback. For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P also gets a fingerprint scanner at the back that\u2019s natively supported by Android Marshmallow. Like most rear-mounted fingerprint scanners, it unlocks instantly in a single touch.Powering the device is a flagship class 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of RAM, which should be more than sufficient to provide a buttery smooth experience. Like all Nexus smartphones (except for the Nexus One by HTC), there\u2019s no expandable microSD slot and it comes with a single nano SIM slot supporting 4G LTE.In terms of cameras, the Nexus 6P focuses on larger pixels rather than the usual pixel count. Despite having a 12.3MP sensor from Sony, it boasts a larger 1.55 \u03bcm pixel size that allows in more light and this apparently is good enough to compensate for the lack of an Optical Image Stabilisation. It gets a dual-tone LED flash, Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus so that you won\u2019t miss a shot. Over at the front, selfies are taken care by its rather large 8MP shooter.Keeping the lights on, the Nexus 6P has a generous 3,450mAh battery and it charges up via a reversible USB Type C port. Out of the box, you get 2 sets of cables \u2013 a USB Type-C to Type-C and the standard USB Type-C to full sized USB. The power adapter pushes a higher 3Amp output through a USB Type-C port which should be faster than standard 2Amp chargers in the market. Of course the main reason why anyone would get a Nexus, is for its pure Android experience without the unnecessary fluff that\u2019s often preinstalled by OEMs.The Nexus 6P will be available online this Thursday (10th December) through Huawei\u2019s  and  Online store. Those who snap up units quickly, Huawei will be throwing in an introductory offer of a  (the first version) worth RM 199, totally free of charge to the first 600.

{"text": "A BlackBerry running Android? Several years ago, the idea would be laughable, but today an Android smartphone could actually make or break this once dominate mobile brand. As BlackBerry continues to lose ground in smartphone , they are pinning  hopes on the . Their first Android device that comes with a slider keyboard. The PRIV will be launched in Malaysia  and we\u2019re lucky enough to get a brief hands-on with this new slider device. At 5.4 inches, the PRIV is the largest smartphone BlackBerry has ever produced and the display features a double curve screen that\u2019s very much like the S6 edge. Though the phone is not wrapped in metal, it does look premium enough for the business-centric user. The back has a grippy texture to it which gives it an assuring feel in the hands, but it took a little while to get used to.When held in the hands, it does have a nice heft to it and despite having a larger screen plus a sliding keyboard mechanism, it is lighter by a couple of grams than the . The sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main highlight of the PRIV, and the mechanism and the design are much improved from the old BlackBerry Torch. When sliding out, the PRIV feels slightly top heavy but it didn\u2019t really bother us while typing. Having used a BlackBerry Bold previously, I found the keyboard to be enjoyable to use. Yes, you do type faster with on-screen keyboards with advance prediction technology but it doesn\u2019t give the same tactile satisfaction as the real deal. Another advantage of using a slider keyboard is that you\u2019ll have an unobstructed display to view your stuff since there\u2019s no on-screen keyboard occupying half of the screen.Like the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard has a couple of neat tricks. It also functions as a touchpad for scrolling and it makes text selection quicker and accurate.  There\u2019s also a text prediction feature that was introduced on BlackBerry 10 and it lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard. In terms of single-handed use, the width of the device is just right and you won\u2019t struggle as much as the BlackBerry Passport that\u2019s super wide. If you\u2019re not using a physical keyboard, the stock BlackBerry keyboard works just fine and you probably could install 3rd party ones like Swype or SwiftKey. I can imagine myself using the virtual keyboard more frequently for quick social updates, replies or while hooked up to a holder while driving. In terms of performance, the PRIV that runs on Android 5.1.1 felt quite smooth and I didn\u2019t experience any noticeable lags in the short time using it. The UI is very stock like and they do integrated a couple of native BlackBerry Apps including the unified BlackBerry Hub. If you\u2019re using an Android device currently, you should feel quite at home but BB10 users might take a while to get used to it as  by their CEO John Chen.So is the BlackBerry PRIV the device to get? Probably the one and the only reason to consider is its physical keyboard. I love the feel of it, I really do and it is something that I find myself using regularly for writing stories or replying emails. But for other things when you just need to shoot a quick reply, the on-screen keyboard does the job just fine. Knowing BlackBerry will definitely  at a premium, we struggle to justify why anyone should get it over the Galaxy Note5. In terms of hardware, the Quad HD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is pretty much mainstream. You could get that on the LG G4 that\u2019s currently going for about RM2,299. Of course, specs is just one factor to consider and the PRIV is also focused on privacy, which they are claiming to be the most if not one of the most secure Android smartphones in the market. Admittedly, I didn\u2019t manage to explore other features such as the 18MP OIS-equipped camera and the DTEK security monitoring tool. Hopefully, we get to do so during the official local launch that\u2019s happening on 8th December.Unless you\u2019re getting this as a company phone, it is quite hard to justify paying more just the keyboard alone. Is there a genuine need for a physical QWERTY keyboard? Several Android brands have tried with the ,  and the , but most of them have ceased to exist. The recent attempt is by Samsung with its  for the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+, but with a less ideal implementation. Could BlackBerry stay relevant in the Android world with the PRIV?

I completely understand this desire to milk every last drop out of your prized cow simply because money is hard to make in this world where piracy is rampant.Generally, many of these spin-offs tend to fall flat and the way I see it, there are two big reasons why this happens. The first is that the show doesn\u2019t live up to the hype. It\u2019s hard to follow in the footsteps of something as big as, say,  for example (we\u2019re looking at you ). Secondly, it doesn\u2019t eventually break off from the original and find and identity of its own, or that special niche that makes a show special.In the world of smartphones, it seems, that there exists this same desire to spin off into various other versions of an OEM\u2019s flagship or popular device.Some spin-offs are designed to make their flagship devices more accessible with lower price points by omitting one or two key features but keeping the feel the same.

{"text": "A few days ago, U Mobile claims the title of  as awarded by Ookla\u2019s . As a gesture of appreciation to its subscribers, they are giving out  for the month of December.So how fast is the fastest? Speedtest has finally revealed the numbers along with the rank of our current fixed and mobile operators in the country. Full details after the break. Starting with mobile networks that are running on 4G LTE, U Mobile is ranked #1 with an average download speed of 22.58Mbps with uploads of 10.34Mbps. Following in 2nd place is Celcom with 19.46Mbps downloads and Maxis holding on to third place at 18.20Mbps. Meanwhile, Digi takes the last place at 17.49Mbps.  For fixed broadband, TM takes up the Top 3 which is a mixture of various identifiers that lead back to Telekom Malaysia. Looking at the speeds, it is safe to assume that all 3 listings are predominantly Unifi subscribers on the highest 20Mbps Unifi plan. This is then followed by Maxis and YTL Communications, that operates Yes 4G WiMAX. Surprisingly Time Broadband didn\u2019t make the list and we feel they could be among the Top 5 if it wasn\u2019t for TM\u2019s duplicated entries. To recap on the , Speedtest measures the average performance of each telco based on the fastest technology possible which is 4G LTE. So in theory, this wouldn\u2019t take into account of speedtests conducted on 3G and on older non-LTE enabled devices. For fixed broadband ISP, the performance is calculated based on the top 10% of each network\u2019s speedtest results. This according to Speedtest is to accurate represent customers that subscribe to the highest tier/package offered by the ISP. While 4G telcos are  the widest, fastest and best network, Speedtest is probably the best independent indicator for now. Another glaring difference between Malaysia versus other countries is that our mobile telcos are delivering faster speeds than our fixed broadband providers. In most cases, the fixed broadband providers in US, Canada, UK and Australia are clocking around 100Mbps or at least 2-3X faster than their fastest 4G operators.

Its 16GB internal storage might set off some alarms with the omission of a microSD slot, especially those inclined to have most of their media with them on the go.For photography (if you\u2019re seriously going to consider that with a tablet), it\u2019ll get an 8-megapixel f/2.0 aperture lens on the rear, that will get you up to FHD video recording. As the front has a 5-megapixel lens, in case of those video calling moments or selfies (again, if you\u2019re seriously considering doing that with a tablet).Two speaker grills will be found on the bottom rear and underneath its backing, there\u2019s a 6190 mAh battery, smaller than before. Xiaomi however, promises it\u2019ll get you 100 hours of music listening and almost 12 and a half hours of video watching.Charging the aforementioned battery will be the USB Type-C port and connector, while other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; sadly, no 4G LTE support makes its way on this device.In terms of software, you\u2019ll find MIUI 7 OS skin, as per usual. Xiaomi has plans on releasing a Windows 10 model soon, but we have no idea when it\u2019ll be announced.Comparing prices abroad in the brand\u2019s domestic market (China), the 16GB sells for roughly RM 662, that\u2019s a RM 200+ premium, that you\u2019re paying for. At the same time, the higher 64GB model retails for about RM 861, so think about that for a second.You pay for what you get it seems and DirectD has the ball in their court, whether or not it\u2019ll be received well, that depends on you guys.[ , ,  ]", "id": "251"},

It\u2019ll also natively support a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot, that allows you to swap up the second SIM for a microSD card. The two devices are quite similar, only altering by screen size, internal storage and battery size.That said, the larger X6 Plus has a 5.7-inch screen of the same resolution, while its internal memory gets bumped up to 64GBs. The smaller of the two will carry a 2,400 mAh battery and the vivo X6 Plus will don a 3,000 mAh battery.

Keeping up with times, Microsoft is putting a USB Type-C port on both models and it supports Qi Wireless Charging and Fast Charge. The Lumia 950 gets a 3,000mAh battery while the bigger sibling gets a larger 3,340mAh capacity unit. In the connectivity department, it ticks all the essential boxes including 4G LTE, NFC, Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac WiFi.

{"text": "A report by the Singapore Straits Times reveals that there is malware lurking within \u2018s update that can affect Android devices. According to the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), this update was not initiated by the app maker and has been infecting Android devices in Singapore over the past few months.After the \u201cupdate\u201d has been downloaded, the malware will prompt the user to enter confidential information, such as credit card details. Then the malware would take over the affected device and intercepts the one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS to the phone for committing fraudulent\u00a0transactions.\u201cCriminals have been targeting computer users, but now criminals have turned to targeting Android phone users as banks are pushing out more banking apps for user convenience,\u201d said ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon. It turns out convenience really is becoming the downfall of humanity as we continuously rely on our devices to carry out daily activities.According to Channel NewsAsia, this vulnerability extends beyond just WhatsApp as they claim the malware is disguising itself as an operating system update as well. They reported that about 50 smartphone users have been hit by malware targeting mobile banking customers in the last three months. Besides disguising itself as a WhatsApp update, it also reportedly masquerades as an operating system update for the battery management module.Channel NewsAsia also reports that ABS estimates the average amounts lost by the victims who are customers of major retail banks in Singapore were \u201ca couple of hundred of dollars\u201d, although some victims could have lost several thousand dollars through multiple transactions. The source of these fraudulent transactions appear to originate from Eastern Europe and includes purchases of budget airline tickets.\u201cJailbroken iPhones or rooted Android [devices] are vulnerable\u2026and in particular Android, because that phone system involves easier download of third-party apps,\u201d said Ong-Ang. The silver lining is that ABS states that banks may refund victims on a case-by-case basis depending on whether or not the victim took the necessary precautions to protect themselves from such attacks.Singapore is awfully close to our home soil of Malaysia, so please be warned and double check your updates before installing them. At the time that this article was written, there has been no official announcement on this matter posted on WhatsApp\u2019s Facebook page, Twitter or Blog.

{"text": "The war for 4G LTE supremacy continues, this time it has spilled over to the prepaid sector as \u2018  has introduced their\u00a0latest plan, Hotlink FAST, which is supposedly designed for the 4G LTE Millennial user. Well, they certainly weren\u2019t kidding when they said it was designed specifically for the 4G LTE user.Hotlink FAST\u2019s starter pack is priced at RM15 and it comes with RM5 preloaded airtime, 300MB preloaded high-speed Internet and offers users a choice of three internet passes. The first plan gives users a 2GB quota for 30 days, then the second plan doubles that up to 4GB and finally the third plan is sort of a \u201clite\u201d version where it gives users 500MB for 7 days. Call rates are the same across all plans at 6sen/30sec to your ACTIV10 (10 Hotlink/Maxis numbers) and 12sen/30sec to all local networks. SMS is rated at 1sen/SMS to your ACTIV10 contacts and 12sen/SMS to all local networks.Users can also apply for an add-on of either 1GB (RM12), 500MB (RM8), or 300MB (RM5) that will last the duration of your quota cycle. On the website, it states that there will be \u201cNo credit drain\u201d and that the \u201cInternet will stop its service once the FAST Internet pass expires.\u201d However, Hotlink informs us that one the quota has been finished, you can still surf the Internet, but at a throttled speed of 64kbps.They explained that although the quota was split between 4G LTE and non-4G LTE speeds, once a user depletes their designated 4G quota, they can continue surfing at 4G speeds but this time it will draw from their \u201cAll Networks\u201d quota instead. Unfortunately, the\u00a0inverse is not true. This means that if you were in a location without 4G LTE coverage, you can only use the \u201cAll Networks\u201d quota, which is half of what you are actually paying for.Now we understand that to create a \u201ccompetitive\u201d plan, compromises have to be made, but surely this doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would Hotlink want to segregate quota by network type? This just seems like a major inconvenience to the consumer.Perhaps this is a testament to , but even that seems like a stretch to try and justify their actions. In any case the plans themselves, if you ignore the split quota, is quite reasonable. So, if you have faith in Maxis\u2019 network coverage and would like to sign up for this plan, existing Hotlink users can do so via the Hotlink RED app by going to \u2018My Account\u2019 and selecting \u2018Change\u2019 next to \u2018Rateplan\u2019.

{"text": "According to a report published in 2013, over  have only done so on a phone, not a traditional or standalone camera. That is a staggering number of people if you think about it, especially taking into consideration the keyword in that phrase is \u2018ever\u2019. Which means that, even two years ago, when smartphone cameras were arguably worse than they are now, people still defaulted to them for that snapshotting needs. This is completely understandable simply because a smartphone is more portable, usually cheaper and are just generally more convenient.Well,  hopes to add to that statistic with their latest , which officially goes on sale in Taiwan today.One of the biggest problems was that most smartphones relied on a digital zoom, which is more like a fancy way to crop your photos if you think about it. The one you want to go for when zooming is the optical zoom, which adjusts the glass positioned in a camera/lens unit to reposition the light hitting the sensor, which brings the image closer but maintains its quality. Most smartphones shy away from using this because having multiple pieces of glass in the camera unit means having more space which in turn translates to a bigger camera hump.The supposedly brilliant thing about the ZenFone Zoom though is that it is the \u201cworld\u2019s thinnest 3x-optical zoom smartphone\u201d. How thin is thin? Well ASUS states that the ZenFone Zoom only has a 5mm edge. Bear in mind, this is the edge, and as the ZenFone line of devices have usually been curved at the back, this looks to be no exception. From the looks of it, the device\u2019s camera unit does take up an enormous amount of space on the back panel ala-, but it doesn\u2019t seem to protrude as much as the Lumia.In a device that is designed to take photographs, most of the actual photography will be taken by the primary 13-megapixel rear shooter while selfies and video chats will be handled by the device\u2019s 5MP front facing unit. Other primary camera goodies include a dual-LED flash, laser autofocus, optical image stabilisation (OIS) and ASUS\u2019 PixelMaster 2.0 camera technology that is designed to greatly improve low light photography, granting up to a 400% increase in brightness. For those curious about the PixelMaster 2.0 technology, we\u2019ve already put it through its paces in our . The ZenFone Zoom will also feature a dedicated shutter button, record button as well as a zoom rocker.Then again, we already expected most of this as the device was announced almost a year ago. What we do know now for sure now is that the device will come in 64GB and 128GB variants. Internal specs include an Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz for the 64GB variant\u00a0while the 128GB variant will be powered by a 2.5GHz Intel Atom Z3590 quad-core processor. Based on the website, it appears that the device will also come with 4GB of RAM and be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS\u2019 BoostMaster quick charging technology. The devices will also come running Android Lollipop out of the box.Display wise, the smartphone will come with a 5.5-inch full HD display with a pixel density of 403 ppi\u00a0tucked away under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The body will also be of an aluminium unibody construction with what looks like a faux leather back to help with grip and texture as well as a ridge at the bottom of the phone to help with one handed photography. But we all know what a unibody means: no removable battery. It does have what looks like a lanyard port and appears to come bundled with a camera strap.The 64GB device retails in Taiwan for TWD13,990 (around RM1,806) while the 128GB will go for TWD15,990 (around RM2,065). While ASUS did not announce when this device will be available in other markets,  has hinted at an , which means it could be any time now. The odd thing is that this device was announced a long time ago, and between its announcement and today ASUS has launched several devices already.This begs the question, what took them so long? Was there a massive kink in the device that delayed its launch this long? Let\u2019s hope they\u2019ve worked out whatever problems they had with it (if they had any problems) lest we have a repeat of .We suspect this device will appeal to some camera enthusiasts who were interested in the Lumia 1020 but not the Windows Mobile platform. While it does seem that this device is a worthy Android equivalent, its sensor is but a measly 13-megapixels versus the Lumia 1020\u2019s 41-megapixel monstrosity. Then again, megapixel isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all of camera quality, so we will just have to wait and see.[, , ]", "id": "263"},
{"text": "Awhile back,  came under fire from critics and the tech community in general when it was discovered that their . This could possibly lead to damage if used with any device other than the . Leading the charge was Google employee Benson Leung who had embarked on a crusade to purge the world of non-compliant USB Type-C cables.His method involved ordering cables off Amazon then testing them to see if they met the USB standards. When he arrived at the OnePlus cable, he found that even a cable manufactured by a proper smartphone manufacturer did not meet proper USB Type-C standards. Needless to say, the Caped Cable Crusader rained sweet justice down on the Chinese manufacturer, bringing them to their knees (metaphorically speaking, of course).Yesterday, OnePlus finally caved and admitted that their cables were indeed non-compliant, but it seems the USB Vigilante still isn\u2019t entirely satisfied.OnePlus graciously accepted Benson and the community\u2019s criticism, openly admitting on their official forum that their USB Type-C cables and adapters were using a 10k\u03a9 resistor instead of the 56k\u03a9 resistor detailed in version 1.1 of the USB Type-C port standard. This message came straight from the top, no less. According to the post, the issue with resistors was that the cables and adapter were only designed for a maximum of 2 amps of power, which is how much the OnePlus 2\u2019s charger supports.However, when used on other devices that allow\u00a0fast-charging, the resistor will let the devices try to draw more power than a power source may\u00a0allow. Ultimately, this could result in damage to said power source (such as 3rd-party cables, USB ports, etc.) if they do not have an internal mechanism to self-regulate the amount of power flowing to or from them.

Do note though that the cables that came bundled in the box with your OnePlus 2 will not be eligible for a refund.\u00a0This is simply because OnePlus remains firm in saying that the cables and adaptors are entirely safe to use with the OnePlus 2 and that the problem was compatibility with other devices.Based on the post, the refund appears to only be available for customers in North America, Europe, India and China, and will only be offered by OnePlus until the end of December this year.

{"text": "Huawei made a doozy after  posting the pricing details of the , on our local vmall website. Now invitations have gone out setting the date for the Google x Huawei collaborative device and by the looks of it, some gift boxes might include them just in time for Christmas.Early adopters might already have the device in their hands, since \u00a0began importing the units last week. They\u2019ve been milking eager fans by a pretty margin but all is fair when it comes to grey importers, we suppose.\u00a0The aforementioned page that went up on vmall.my listed the device will be on sale for RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the 64GB model; which is equally stacked against another Huawei device, the  (64GB). Easily pointing to the manufacturer not wanting to bite themselves in the butt by selling the Nexus at a lower price, to keep some emphasis on their other smartphones.Playing down the state of our currency, it\u2019s likely the heighten pricing is to leave some leeway for the Ringgit to continue to fluctuate. Taking into consideration that the 32GB Nexus 6P sells for US$ 499 (RM 2,128) and the 64GB model goes for US$ 549 (RM 2,341) in the US.The collaborative effort will bring about the latest version of Android, with Marshmallow finally coming into the horizon. Sizing in at 5.7-inches, you\u2019ll get a QHD display (2560 x 1440), with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 under the hood. Internal memory options were listed above, while it\u2019ll carry 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM for multitasking and app switching.In terms of photography, there will be a 12.3-megapixel sensor on the rear that\u2019s equip with 1.55 micron pixels and an aperture of f/2.0 for those low light situations. Accompanying the camera module will be a dual-tone LED and laser auto focus as well. Taking a look at the front, an 8-megapixel f2.4 shutter will greet you near the top; this sensor will carry a 1.4-micron pixel size.For audio, it\u2019ll boast dual front facing stereo speakers on the top and bottom, while Huawei also deploys USB Type-C for data and charging utilisation. The port itself, will help charge up the 3,450mAh battery that\u2019s inside, while \u00a0the future-proof port will help bring it up to speed, just a little quicker \u2013 only on particular \u00a0though; nope those Quick Charge 2.0 charging heads won\u2019t be of any use.The last bell and whistle would be the Nexus Imprint finger print sensor, that sits below the rear camera lens. A feature that pretty much lined up with Google\u2019s vision to make native fingerprint scanning a thing on Android M.The announcement couldn\u2019t come any sooner, since they\u2019ve been consumers who are itching to get their own units after DirectD started offering the smartphone.

{"text": "The rainy season is in full effect now with many parts of the country experiencing constant downpour each day. And with the tide phenomenon that is expected to occur in the Straits of Tebrau from the 24th to 30th of November is likely to mean more trouble for affected locals.Malaysia has had its fair share of flood woes in the past and since it\u2019s the rainy season again, the folks at Communications and Multimedia Consumer Forum of Malaysia (CFM) have decided to take a more proactive role to ensure effective communication during these potentially trying times remains strong.CFM have sent us a long list of tips that are designed to help the public better manage as well as communicate more effectively during times of emergency. We at SoyaCincau.com value your time and as a result have condensed their tips for your convenience.Here are the 6 communication tips during floods:\u00a0CFM strongly urges the public to be patient when communicating. If your call or msg is unable to get through to the other person, wait awhile before trying again. The communication infrastructure is put under a lot of stress during times of emergency and can get congested due to the high volume of messages. So, if everyone incessantly tries to communicate, it becomes less likely that any messages will get through at all.It\u2019s sort of like traffic congestion, really. If everyone leaves their office at 6pm, then nobody would be getting anywhere anytime soon.\u00a0We know some of you have completely abandoned the SMS service, because frankly who needs it when you have free messaging applications like Whatsapp? But, CFM advises users to use this \u2018retro\u2019 form of communication during emergencies because they take up less bandwidth and will put a lighter load on the communication system.If we were to build on our traffic jam analogy, a call would be that large BMW 750Li, while a text message would only be a little Vespa zipping along between traffic.\u00a0Needless to say, without power, that flagship smartphone you paid thousands of ringgit for is about as useful as a brick. Probably less useful since its so light and thin, so CFM encourages its consumers to charge up your devices and power banks when there is power. That way, if and when the power goes down, you will still have enough juice to keep your phones running.Of course, saving power also means using your devices less often. Save them for emergencies and only use them when you absolutely have to, not to post a selfie on Instagram. If your device has power saving mode, it is recommended to enable it to extend its battery life. \u00a0Speaking of Instagram, CFM implores everyone to limit their online activity to avoid coverage congestion. Actions like uploading photos, videos or sharing voice clips on social media consumes a lot of bandwidth and by now we\u2019re sure you all know what that means. Yep, you guessed it, congestion.10 points to Gryffindor!\u00a0We\u2019ve all seen disaster movies. We\u2019ve all seen the scene where the protagonists are trapped in a danger zone and are waiting by the radio with bated breath for information that could very well save them. Well, it turns out there is some truth in those scenes as CFM says that it becomes an important source of news during an emergency. However, they have stated that consumers should ensure that they have an adequate battery supply before doing so.You can also get the latest updates from local emergency response services or RELA members so it\u2019s a good idea to keep their contact handy.\u00a0Well, keep calm. There really is\u00a0no use in panicking during an emergency.\u00a0CFM informs us that they aren\u2019t sitting on their hands at their end either. The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)\u00a0are working\u00a0with all Telecommunications Service Providers (SPs) to provide temporary base communication station towers at several affected areas as a support to enhance the coverage during floods or natural disasters.However, they did add that priority will be given to places that are in need of it the most. They also ask for your understanding that natural disasters can cause unavoidable damage to infrastructure in affected areas which would result in less than stellar coverage.Teamwork is key in these situations so do be considerate and work together to overcome times of emergency.\u00a0[]", "id": "267"},

In their latest ad, Samsung isn\u2019t calling it a TV or a Tablet, but simply \u201centertainment reimagined\u201d.Since both TV and tablets are generally media consumption devices, Samsung attempts to blur the line between the two, offering a larger screen experience in a somewhat \u201cportable\u201d form factor. Weighing at about 2.65kg, it is heavier than your average mobile device. With a handle at the back of the kickstand, Samsung wants it to be as easy to carry as a shopping bag.According to Samsung, the Galaxy View is designed to be used from an arm\u2019s reach, hence they have created a new UI with larger icons and text for a more intuitive experience. Furthermore, the way people watch TV is much different now, with more opting to look for content when they want it, rather than to follow broadcast programs. For gaming, the Galaxy View has an S Console game app, where you can project your mobile games onto a bigger screen. It turns your smart phone into a controller for a console gaming-like experience. While the hardware could potentially replace a TV, it is a pity that Samsung hasn\u2019t included the essential TV ports such as HDMI. This could have opened up the Galaxy View as a portable TV for console gaming or to connect to other AV equipment. In the US, it is currently priced at US$499 which is about RM2,110. It gets a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM and there\u2019s a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of storage that\u2019s expandable with microSD.

{"text": "Let\u2019s face it. The internet is full of vulnerabilities and even our smart phones isn\u2019t spared from exploits. Having your data stolen is not funny but you can take action now with Zipit Chat.Using a globally recognised encryption system, it gives you a peace of mind when communicating with your peers. So how does Zipit Chat work? Read on to find out.Zipit Chat is currently available for Android devices and you can download it directly from the . For new users, activation is as easy as entering your mobile number and enter the verification code that\u2019s sent to you. You\u2019ll receive a unique Zipit ChatID that looks like a BlackBerry PIN and you can set your password between 6-16 digits. Once that\u2019s out of the way, you can start inviting your family and friends from your contact list.There are plenty of instant messaging apps out there but nobody does security better than Zipit Chat. Encrypted with AES 256 technology, your messages are impossible for anyone to intercept which gives you a true end to end encryption. When transmitting sensitive information such as password, pins or confidential information, you can set a Self-Destruct Timer from 30 seconds up to 10 minutes. For an extra layer of security, Zipit Chat even disables your phone screenshot function, so that nobody could snap a copy of it. Emails are still relevant these days and for business users, there are messages that are highly P&C. We\u2019ve heard stories of email accounts being hacked and if it does happen to you, Zipit Chat can keep your email threads secured with the same military grade encryption. The content will be scrambled including its attachments and only the intended sender and recipient can view it fully via Zipit Chat. If you\u2019re unconvinced, Celcom had earlier issued a challenge for anyone to decrypt 3 messages that are encrypted by Zipit Chat and nobody has managed to crack it so far. So even if some snooping agency or hackers have gain access to your inbox, it would take probably years to figure it out by brute force. Most people would have different logins and passwords for various accounts including online banking. If you find it hard to keep track of all of them, you jot them down safely under Zipit Chat\u2019s Secure Notes. Similar to its email feature, it scrambles your note into a bunch of unreadable text, thus ensuring only you are able to read it. While it is not recommended to store passwords on your phone, at least you know there\u2019s a safer way to keep from prying eyes. Having your phone stolen is bad enough and the last thing you want is to have your personal data stolen. With Zipit Chat, your messages, notes and emails are always password protected at all times. When left inactive, it will constantly require your pin number to launch the app.For another layer of secrecy, there\u2019s a rather clever Stealth Mode which removes the Zipit Chat icon completely from your smart phone. To access the app again, just dial #*# followed by your pin number and then hit the call button.   Are you still putting your communication at risk? Just head over the  to download Zipit Chat. It costs RM10/month to subscribe but you can give it a try for free.", "id": "269"},

TMgo was launched while the TM-P1 partnership was still pending approval, so it ran at a lower 850MHz frequency instead of the usual 1800MHz/2600MHz bands used by mainstream 4G operators.Now, with the full support of P1 at their backs, TM can really flex its muscles and push their way into the four-horse race. As with any industry, having more competition will only be beneficial for the consumer. With more competition, telcos have to tread carefully to keep their services relevant and avoid being run over by competition.With a major telecommunications player like TM entering the mobile services scene, you can expect the existing players who are currently locked in a four-way-free-for-all for LTE supremacy, to scramble and make sure the upstart new challenger doesn\u2019t take their crown away from them.In any case, if TM successfully makes their way into the mobile sector, it can only mean good things for us consumers.

KPDNKK\u2019s Intellectual Property Enforcement Division head Othman Nawang said that based on the information and intelligence gathered during the KPDNKK\u2019s investigation, they had conclusive evidence to carry out the raid on these two locations suspected of selling counterfeit OPPO products.Sure enough the raid was a success as the joint task force uncovered 8 counterfeit devices worth over RM4,200.

{"text": "When the idea of a smartwatch started gaining traction, many suspected that the watchmaking industry would eventually try to take it over. It seemed like a logical thing to do to keep up with the times. thought so too and while initial models of their Q line hardly looked high-tech, their latest smartwatch, the Q Founder, does.The Q Founder is Fossil\u2019s first ever smartwatch to be powered by Android Wear and it\u2019s the watchmaker\u2019s attempt at mating \u201cmodern functionality and classic good looks\u201d. With this watch, Fossil hoped to give smartwatches the \u201chigh-end-yet-mass-appeal design Fossil\u2019s known for\u201d.Previous devices in the Q line, namely the Q Reveler and Q Dreamer bracelets, and the Q Grant watch were made to be jewelry first, technology second and it showed. To the untrained eye, it is nearly impossible to know that they were high tech smart wearables.Fossil\u2019s new Q Founder though, is entirely different. This device sports a full touch screen interface on its round watch face similar to that of the . Unfortunately, it also has the Moto 360\u2019s flat tire design, instead of a fully round display.If classic watch looks were what Fossil was going for then the Q Founder does pull that off quite well. It certainly doesn\u2019t look like it was  or one that could be .It is rather large though, coming in with a 46mm-diameter face and a 13mm-thick case which is the same as the expensive TAG Heuer Connected. Feature-wise, the smartwatch has a built in activity tracker that will help you track your steps, count calories and all the other good stuff. It\u2019s also IP67 water and dust resistant so it\u2019ll at least give you some peace of mind. Fossil estimates that the device will last one day on a single charge of the device\u2019s 400 mAh battery.In terms of what actually powers the device, no information is available aside from the fact that it is likely an Intel processor due to their partnership. The device will also have 4GB of internal storage, an accelerometer and a gyroscope.Traditional watchmakers often  as more of a plaything that wouldn\u2019t stand the test of time.

{"text": "When we announced that \u2018 offline navigation had finally rolled out in Malaysia, many rejoiced, but apparently not everyone is happy with being able to rely on navigation applications just a little more. UMNO lawmaker Datuk Raime Unggi said in Parliament today that Malaysian dependency on navigation apps to find their way around the maze-like labyrinth of Kuala Lumpur\u2019s bustling city centre, was possibly exposing our country to \u201cexternal threats\u201d from foreign countries.The Tenom MP proceeded to elaborate that this was because when users use these applications for location searching, it indirectly provides information about Malaysia to external quarters such as the United States and Israel. The reason he cited these two countries, we assume, is because Google is headquartered in the US while Google owned Waze was developed in Israel.Kuala Selangor MP Datuk Irmohizam Ibrahim said that our nation cannot compromise when it comes to national security. He also brings up the issue about the extent to which our laws could protect such information leaks.\u201cHow far do we have laws that prevent information leaks in the usage of Google Map(s) and Waze?\u201d he asks the Parliament. \u201cAre there laws to make sure national security protected in the usage of such apps?\u201dCommunications and Multimedia Deputy Minister Datuk Jailani Johari reassured the concerned MPs that it was up to the users to decide how much personal information they wished to share and that they could choose to stop using the apps if they disagreed with the privacy policies.Jailani adds that the apps function based on privacy policies that are agreed upon by the individual and the application provider, be it Waze or Google Maps. If the user\u00a0decides that they do not want to continue using the service, they can terminate the agreement and the provider will no longer hold on to their data.\u201cWe have yet to receive any report on any apps used for spying purposes.\u2018The real issue is that our users are fond of over-sharing private information on the Internet. This results in the information being misused. As a smart internet user, we should have our own controls,\u201d said Jailani, who is also the MP for Hulu Terengganu.Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed also downplayed the danger claimed to be posed by the navigation applications, saying that these applications have helped citizens navigate more than it helps terrorists. He did however say that he acknowledges the security concerns, but he feels that the pros outweigh the cons.Kuala Krai MP Dr Mohd\u00a0Hatta Ramli raised another concern that if the government decides to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) it could give foreign countries access to Malaysian personal data collected by the aforementioned navigation applications.\u201cOur personal data used to be kept within the borders of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNow with TPP, we must not allow it to be taken out of the county. We have a lot personal data that we would not like to share with other people.\u201d. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a 12-nation free trade agreement backed by the United States which is set to be debated in Malaysia in January next year.Opposition MP for Kelana Jaya Wong Chen said that the free trade treaty required Malaysia to allow transfer of electronic information to foreign countries. \u201cTPP prohibition on data localisation laws (Article 14.13) essentially means personal info that is hosted abroad would be subject to different laws on privacy,\u201d he said. Wong further explained that under this, your personal data could be subjected to US surveillance laws such as the US Patriot Act, instead of\u00a0our own privacy laws.[, , , ]", "id": "280"},

Many owe this bad performance to the OEM\u2019s disappointing 2015 flagship the  and how HTC didn\u2019t go back to the drawing board when developing it.\u00a0Perhaps it was because they were stubborn, or perhaps it was because of a lack of communication between the company and their customers that put them in this predicament.Well, HTC must\u2019ve figured it was the latter because the\u00a0smartphone manufacturer just announced that they are opening up the HTC Preview Program to all in the hope that it would help them better understand what exactly their customers want.In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on social, news and entertainment aggregation website Reddit, HTC\u2019s USA Preview Team announced their intention to find a new way to connect back to the Android community, as well as answer any questions the community might have about this program. In a nutshell, this program will allow HTC fans to get their hands on the company\u2019s latest software and hardware before it is released, in exchange for daily use and feedback.Yes, hardware too. In the  hosted on the Preview website, it is stated that while those selected to participate in this program will occasionally require participants to use their own devices, depending on the specific HTC Preview projects, the OEM may also provide loaner devices too. It seems\u00a0like a good opportunity\u00a0to get your hands on some unreleased HTC hardware.Of course, as the primary purpose of this program is to identify daily user habits, user information and feedback has to be collected by the company. However, HTC has clarified that while there will be logs running in the background to collect data on network/signal strength, battery information, usage times and apps used, they will not collect any sensitive personal data or tell what you are looking at on your screen unless you explicitly take a screenshot to share with them.They also clarified that one of the reasons they have opened up the HTC Preview program is to have actual hard facts and feedback on what their users want. This is so that they have actual data backing them when they tell executives what their customers want, which in turn makes it easier to have an impact on change within the company.HTC also reassured the community that they will take the feedback from this program very seriously and will tweak their upcoming devices to improve based on that information. They also added that if feedback for a device is overwhelmingly negative, they would even use that information to evaluate a product\u2019s release.This is a very bold move by HTC, bringing what looks like, on the surface at least, more transparency to their product development. It should also ignite a warm fire in the hearts of HTC fans who have been clamouring for their voices to be heard and who are passionate about helping the company grow past these hard times.However, as this has only just been launched, the actual effectiveness of this program remains to be seen. They could just be all talk and have no action. For whatever it\u2019s worth, let\u2019s hope this does help them get back on its feet because it would be such a shame if the company, which had brought us one of the most beautiful metal unibody designs, fell out of the race.For those of you who are interested, you can also participate in the HTC Preview program, just head on over to  and follow the instructions there.[, ]", "id": "281"},

Offering the same compact 7.9\u2033 size, the new tablet gets an all metal body which is a huge leap over the plasticky predecessor.Compared to the previous version, the new Mi Pad 2 is 18% thinner at 6.95mm (Mi Pad: 8.5mm) and it is 11% lighter at 322g (Mi Pad: 360g). The Mi Pad 2 is also narrower and shorter as well, thanks to its reduced bezel design. The front 7.9\u2033 display is pretty much retained with a 2048\u00d71536 resolution that pushes a pixel density of 326 ppi. This is the same resolution as the current . Some of the new improvements include a Reading Mode which cuts down on harmful blue light and a button lock feature which deactivates the capacitive home, menu and back buttons when the tablet is held in landscape. While the old Mi Pad runs on Nvidia\u2019s Tegra K1 chipset, the Mi Pad 2 is Xiaomi\u2019s first Intel-powered device with a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 processor with 2GB of RAM. Storage wise it receives the same options of either 16GB or 64GB of storage. This time round, it appears that it lacks a microSD expansion slot, which isn\u2019t good news for those wanting to store loads of TV shows on their tablet. The cameras combination appears unchanged with a 8MP f/2.0 camera capable of shooting full HD videos at the rear while the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter. The twin speaker grilles are still placed at the back, which could have been better placed at the front or at least on the sides.Powering the tablet is a smaller 6,190mAh battery that claims to push 100 hours of music playback or 12.5 hours of video streaming. It uses the new USB Type C connector to charge and it supports a typical 5V/2A fast charging standard. In terms of connectivity, it supports Bluetooth 4.1 and high speed 802.11ac WiFi. Like the predecessor, there\u2019s no cellular 4G LTE version available. Out of the box, the Mi Pad 2 runs on MIUI 7 OS that\u2019s based on Android. The 16GB Mi Pad 2 goes for 999 CNY (about RM662) while the 64GB version is priced at 1,299 CNY (about RM861), which is pretty decently priced for the hardware and build quality it offers. If you\u2019re looking for something different, Xiaomi is also releasing a Windows 10 64GB edition as well for the same price of 1,299 CNY.

However, in terms of raw air cleaning power, the new model\u00a0appears to fall short of the previous version, but not by a lot.Probably due to its size, the second-gen purifier\u00a0outputs\u00a0clean air in two modes, measuring a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of 330 m3/h of clean air in standard mode and 388 m3/h of clean air in active mode, both of which are lower than the original Mi Air Purifier\u2019s 406 m3/h. Cleaning range is also lower at up to 46.6 m2 of cleaning range, compared to the first-gen\u2019s 48 m2 of effective coverage.It can also be attributed to the device\u2019s single-motor, dual-fan setup versus its predecessor\u2019s dual-motor, 4-air-duct engine.

Although the\u00a0roll-out had officially begun, offline support for many parts of the world, including Malaysia, was still missing.Finally, after much anticipation, the application supports offline navigation within our home soil.With this feature, users can expect an improved navigation experience using the Maps app especially in areas where connectivity is bad, or when you want to save those precious few bytes of your quota. Google employs two different uses for their new offline navigation feature. The first is to bolster online navigation with the app, when connectivity is spotty at best, allowing Maps to freely switch between offline and online mode ensuring that you don\u2019t lose crucial navigation information just because you entered an area with bad coverage.The second method is where users can opt to switch off connectivity completely and rely on the app to navigate with the pre-downloaded offline areas. To download an area, simply key in the location (or tap and hold a\u00a0point on the map) and swipe up on the card that appears at the bottom. Then, select \u2018download\u2019 on the resulting screen, specify your desired region and tap the download button once more.Downloaded maps are stored on your device, so remember to free up some space before you decide to give this feature a spin. As an estimate, the amount of space required to download the greater area of Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur is about 300MB, whereas if you want offline navigation for Peninsular Malaysia, you will need to free up at least 1.5GB of space.Offline maps can be kept on your device for a total of 30 days. By default, stored locations will be updated via WiFi but that can be changed in the offline areas settings to allow for updates to be downloaded over a mobile network or to not be updated at all.This is definitely a bold move by Google, stepping into the world of offline navigation, but whether this move will pay off remains to be seen.

To make matters worse,  had only offered a vague explanation as to why the device was taken off the shelves late last week.This week, LG have finally decided to open up a little more and reveals that the device was pulled because of an issue with its display.When LG initially axed the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, the company  that there was a problem with the smartwatch\u2019s hardware and it affected \u201cday-to-day functionality of the device\u201d. Because of the \u201ccomplicated nature of the issue\u201d LG told Android Police that they would be cancelling the rollout of the device indefinitely.

To no surprise, we\u2019re expecting the \u00a0 line to face the same fortunate (for us) fate.Addressing the potential processors inside the device before, today, new reports are alleging that Samsung might re-equip their flagships with one feature that when left out, have scorned their existing customer base; more so when Malaysia and other regions only received the 32GB for purchase option \u2013 yes, we mean reinstating a microSD slot on the smartphone(s)A plethora of options open up with 2016 on the horizon, with new processors and new camera technology, the possibilities are endless. The year will mark the latest generation of mobile processors as it\u2019ll bring about launches of the Exynos 8890, Kirin 950, and the Qualcomm 820 \u2013 no matter how unnecessary these high-end chipsets might be, the thirst for more power and futureproofing devices aren\u2019t slowing down one bit.It\u2019s likely that the Galaxy S7 series will see two SoC options, one Exynos and one Qualcomm; both models listed above, though they might be region specific.

It will also come with a microSD card slot allowing for storage expansion of up to 200GB.On the other hand, the bigger Lumia 950 XL will feature a larger 5.7-inch (2560\u00d71440 pixels) QHD AMOLED ClearBlack display but with Gorilla Glass 4 on top instead of its younger brother\u2019s Gorilla Glass 3.Internals see the Lumia 950 XL powered by a 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board memory.

{"text": "Let\u2019s roll back for a second to let everyone know the timeline of leaks, rumours and announcements of \u2018s purported two device launch. Word had gotten out of TENAA that a smartphone had passed its certification; after which details of the  were spotted on Geekbench.Then on it got a whole lot for confusing, as  of the event went out and Xiaomi\u2019s President  of the two devices. We\u2019re going to try and make it easier for everyone to understand, at the same time giving out two cents on the whole situation.Metal isn\u2019t one of the materials you\u2019d usually find on a Xiaomi product, except for their higher-end range flagships \u2013 though the Mi Note and Mi 4 only explore using the element in minimal amounts, seen around the edges. The brand however, hasn\u2019t started even considering finger print sensors on their flagships, hence the peculiarity of placing the aforementioned feature on the Redmi Note 2 Pro.It\u2019ll be a totally new take, for the Redmi name if they decide to pursue the two features. Otherwise, it\u2019ll have\u00a0the same internals as its predecessor\u00a0underneath. Moving to the other device that\u2019s slated to launch, the Mi Pad 2; a device that didn\u2019t confuse us as much as the former. Details on Geekbench made this short and sweet, stating what processor\u00a0it\u2019ll carry; an Intel Atom processor clocked to 2.24GHz and other accompanying specs.Xiaomi\u2019s President didn\u2019t stop there either, shortly after a few days, he decided to release photos of the smartphone and tablet. Leading us to finally cave in and actually believe that the company will release a follow up to the Redmi Note 2 before the same fiscal quarter comes to a close.Since then, more images go to contradict the existence of the Redmi Note 2 Pro, mentioning that it\u2019ll instead be dubbed the Redmi Note 3. So far we know that it\u2019ll be thin, light, have a fingerprint sensor and metal body. It isn\u2019t farfetched to assume that Xiaomi wants to appeal to the higher-end market but adding two features on a non-flagship could either be a weird strategy or an opening of doors to more premium products in the future from the Chinese tech giant; yes, the Mi 5 too.Interestingly,\u00a0new (rumoured) details have highlighted that the Redmi Note 3 will have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It\u2019ll also supposedly be available with a 4000 mAh battery, making a huge jump from the existing device that only has a 3060 mAh battery.Maybe this long-shot might work for Xiaomi but we\u2019re sure Redmi Note 2 customers won\u2019t be too happy with this new information. We\u2019ll wait for tomorrow to see what actually happens, who knows they might pull a \u201cby the way\u201d move and surprise everyone with more than two devices.[ , ,\u00a0 ]", "id": "296"},

Internal storage is rated at 32GB but that\u2019s expandable up to 128GB with a microSD card. The phone also has dual-SIM capabilities and supports 4G LTE.Beneath the Vibe P1\u2019s aluminium body lies its party piece, the enormous 5,000 mAh battery with quick charge support. Security is also beefed up with a fingerprint scanner located underneath the physical home button. Camera wise, the Vibe P1 sports a 13-megapixel rear shooter with PDAF and a dual-LED flash alongside a 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera that is enhanced with a host of beauty features.On the other hand, the lower end Vibe P1m will instead be packaged with a 5-inch 720p HD display with a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage running under the hood. The P1m also supports expandable memory in the form of a microSD card up to 32GB.\u00a0As a little cherry on top, the Vibe P1m will also get a splash-proof nano coating that will protect itself from accidental spills.In the optics department, the Vibe P1m gets a watered down 8-megapixel back + 5-megapixel front camera combo.

{"text": "It\u2019s official. Soft drink mega-corporation Pepsi has taken its first step into the mobile industry by launching its own crowdfunding campaign on JD Finance to , the Pepsi Phone P1.Back in October,\u00a0 that the soft-drink manufacturer would be releasing their own line of mobile accessories and even their own smartphone based in China. While preliminary specs were leaked, the information train stopped there and interest in the device screeched to a halt.Now that the world\u2019s 29th most valuable brand has pulled back the covers of its pet project, we finally get to see some cold, hard specs.The device will come sporting a 5.5\u201d 1080p display housed under 2.5D glass, with an octa-core 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6792 processor and 2GB of RAM at its heart. It only has 16GB of internal storage but that\u2019s expandable via a hybrid dual-SIM tray up to 64GB. Out of the box, the device is said to run on Android 5.1 Lollipop with dido OS 6.1 plastered on top.For imaging, the device runs a 13-megapixel (f/2.0, 1/3.06 CMOS sensor) back snapper and 5-megapixel front camera combo. Interestingly, the Phone P1 also mounts a fingerprint scanner on the back of the device, right below the camera. To bring all of these parts to life, the phone will draw power from a 3,000 mAh battery.Since it\u2019s a crowdfunding project, the device will be available through several layers of perks and support. The early bird option allowed interested parties to get the phone for CNY499 (around RM335), but that was only limited to the first 1,000 supporters. You can still opt for the limited CNY699 (around RM468) option which is still a good deal. Backers can also opt to get the phone at its full price of CNY1,299 (around RM870) instead.With only two weeks remaining, the Pepsi Phone P1 is still a long, long way from being funded so there is a chance that this whole thing could just fizzle out. If it does succeed though, it would be interesting to see if Pepsi\u2019s nemesis Coca-Cola would take a gander at a mobile device.Specs wise, the phone looks like a fairly ordinary midrange device, but with its metal body we suspect that people will buy this purely as a novelty item rather than to use as a daily driver. All we\u2019d like to see is for the device come in a phone sized Pepsi can instead of a boring old smartphone box.[, , ]", "id": "308"},
{"text": "Mistaken as the , Korean electronics giant  have quietly revealed their latest handset, the W2016. If you\u2019re familiar with Samsung\u2019s line of clamshell smartphones running Android, then it should come as no surprise that many thought this latest flip phone was going to be the successor to the Galaxy Golden 2.This new flip phone is no underpowered feature phone though. Sporting two 3.9\u201d AMOLED displays pushing 1280\u00d7768 pixels, an \u00a0chip, 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, this flip phone is essentially a  in a forgotten form factor. The primary camera is no slouch either as it likely the same high end 16-megapixel rear snapper as that in Samsung\u2019s early 2015 flagship, with a 5-megapixel front camera to boot.Samsung\u2019s W2016 will run  5.1.1 Lollipop with TouchWiz out of the box and the Korean manufacturer has also included modern elements like fast wired and wireless charging. Powering the device is a 2,000 mAh battery, which should be more than enough for the relatively small 3.9\u201d screens to stay lit for a respectable amount of time.To many, the clamshell form factor is a thing of the past and it seems weird that Samsung would put so much into reviving it. But to some niche markets in Asia and nostalgic fans of this once glorious design, this is a welcomed move and we can see why.Aesthetically, the W2016 looks exquisite. The body is a sculpted aluminium frame that kind of emulates the Galaxy S6\u2019s design, with a curved metal back and metallic accents. The screen sits flush into the front panel and the gentle slope towards the bottom of the phone gives it a much sleeker look. It looks like the kind of sophisticated device meant for the 0.01%, and not some playboy\u2019s new gadget.Availability of the device at this point seems to be limited to China, without any news on whether or not it will make it to the rest of the world. While we do not have information on the pricing of the device, we wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if it will eventually be sold elsewhere.On paper, the W2016 looks like a great way to bring the clamshell into today\u2019s standards. For those of us who have used flip phones in the past, there is no doubt that we will remember this form factor fondly. Let\u2019s face it, there aren\u2019t many more satisfying ways to end a conversation than with the solid click of a clamshell snapping shut.[, ]", "id": "309"},
{"text": "Launched recently, the  and  are designed to last as long as you can with its enormous battery capacities of 5,000 mAh and 4,000 mAh respectively. These smartphones from  can also, in a pinch, double as powerbanks and charge your other devices via USB OTG (On-The-Go). As you can tell by the battery capacities, the Vibe P1 is designed to be the flag bearer of the \u201cPower Player\u201d line, while the Vibe P1m comes in as the runner-up.On paper that is very much the case as the Vibe P1 sports a 5.5\u2033 full-HD IPS display and a brushed aluminium frame. The device\u2019s\u00a0unibody construction gives it a premium feel with a gentle curve at the back allowing the phone to fit nicely in the hand. In front you will find the front camera at the top and two capacitive buttons at the bottom, flanking the rectangular physical home button. Underneath the clicky, well-built button lies the Vibe P1\u2019s fingerprint scanner which is a first for Lenovo.Around the back, the smartphone looks a lot like the flagships from \u00a0series. The main\u00a0camera can be found at the top of the phone with the dual-LED flash right below it. The power button and volume keys are placed on the right side of the phone while the Vibe P1\u2019s dedicated power saver toggle is located on the left. To differentiate the buttons, the power saver toggle has rough texture versus the smooth power and volume buttons. Either way, all the keys have a satisfying click without much wobble.The speaker grille and micro-USB port is located at the bottom opposite the phone\u2019s headphone jack at the top. The top comes off revealing a tray that holds two nano-SIM cards and a microSD slot. As a whole, the device feels good in the hand. Even with that massive battery, the weight isn\u2019t unbearable although it is rather thick and that adds to the bulk. The brushed aluminium helps the phone stay in the hand while staving off fingerprints.Much of the Vibe P1\u2019s physical features are identical on its little brother, with the exception of the micro-USB port being on the top and the absence of a physical home button and fingerprint scanner on the Vibe P1m. Around the back, the primary camera is in the same place as the Vibe P1 but there is a brushed metal finish around the lens LED flash. The front is occupied by the Vibe P1m\u2019s 5-inch 720p display, three capacitive buttons and the 5-megapixel camera at the top. The device is coated with a splash-proof nano coating.While the P1m does not have a brushed aluminium back, the textured removable rear cover feels very nice and sturdy, giving the phone even more grip. The smaller size also fits better in the hand, making up for its rather thick profile.Within\u00a0the Vibe P1 beats the heart of an octa-core Snapdragon 615 clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and, 32GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). On the other hand, the lower end\u00a0Vibe P1m is powered by a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but it is also expandable via microSD up to 32GB.Performance is good as both devices run smoothly on Android 5.1 Lollipop with almost no stuttering or noticeable lag when launching, exiting or switching between applications. It looks like Lenovo spent some time making sure that the software and hardware for both devices were well optimised. Then again, the Vibe P1m\u2019s smooth performance can also be credited to the fact that it has less pixels to push on that smaller 720p display.Primary imaging on the Vibe P1 is taken care of by its 13-megapixel PDAF rear shooter while selfies can be delegated to the 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera. Our limited time\u00a0with the Vibe P1\u2019s camera reveals that it is snappy to launch and take pictures, but the venue\u2019s poor lighting made it difficult to give a solid verdict on the camera\u2019s performance. The same can also be said for the Vibe P1m\u2019s 8-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo.Sitting under the back plate, powering all those hardware bits,\u00a0lies the devices\u2019 defining feature: their massive batteries. The Vibe P1 sports a 5,000 mAh battery that Lenovo claims gives the device 30 days of standby time and 45 hours of talk time. The phone also comes with Quick Charge 2.0 for when it eventually runs out of juice. Lenovo said that it would take 2 hours to charge up the P1 from empty using the device\u2019s bundled charger.The Vibe P1m features a smaller, but still massive by conventional standards, 4,000 mAh battery. Besides the massive batteries, Lenovo took power saving to the next level with their included power saver toggle, available on both devices.With the power saver toggle flicked on, the phone enters power saver mode where the usual home screen is replaced by a simple black and white interface, showing you the clock, the battery level, a choice of six apps and how much time you have left before the phone runs out of juice. Very Jack Bauer. The six apps can be set by the user but by default three of the app slots are taken up by phone, contacts, and messaging.The Lenovo Vibe P1 which retails for RM1,199, will come in Platinum and Graphite Grey colour options. This device will be available in authorised retail stores and  starting 19 November. On the other hand, the Vibe P1m, costing RM649, will  from\u00a019 November onwards, only hitting the shelves at authorised local retail outlets in December. As a bonus though, if you do choose to purchase the Vibe P1m from Lazada, they\u2019re currently offering an RM50 discount and are throwing in a Lenovo Limited Edition Jersey and an 8GB SanDisk microSD card for free.", "id": "310"},

Fortunately, the One M9s will have the option to expand its storage up to 2TB via a microSD card.

Unfortunately, no word on worldwide availability has been given. Although the HTC One M9 was not officially launched in Malaysia, you can get an imported one from DirectD for RM2,699.As a whole, the One M9s seems to be a light version of its older One M9 brother, with less RAM and internal storage, but, on paper at least, the camera should be better than the One M9 despite the drop in megapixels, because it comes with OIS.Is that a trade-off you are willing to make?

It seems that the success of its competitors and the demand for premium metal builds was too tempting to give up and so recent rumours suggest that we could see a premium feeling metal LG G5 coming next year.However, switching over to a metal unibody would probably mean that LG are ditching the removable back and battery that have been present in most of their recent smartphones, including the , G4, and even the \u201cextra-premium\u201d LG V10. Many of the big players in the smartphone industry have moved away from phones with removable backs and removable batteries, leaving LG as the only relatively well-known smartphone manufacturer to have this feature.Ditching one of their, frankly key, features could cause users who prioritise this feature to now have to look elsewhere, which is something LG would rather\u00a0avoid, considering their already small\u00a0market share.Rumours also indicate that we could see it as early as Q1 of 2016,  as Samsung\u2019s .

Though their definition of what 4G LTE speeds are, could baffle many.Beginning the discussion of the who\u2019s the widest 4G LTE provider in October, they had  listed the 4G LTE coverage to be 50%; but is a 10% jump a realistic in such a short span? (we\u2019re asking the same question) Anyway, by Digi\u2019s valuation, their 4G LTE network will deliver more than 5Mbps 80% of the time \u2013 petty by industry .They\u2019ve also ramped up the number of network sites in Malaysia, adding 52 additional cell towers in the process. Furthermore, the telco provider mentions that of their 2 specified signal spectrums \u2013 1,800Mhz and 2,600Mhz, there is now a 30% overlap. Simply going to say that a highly dense area won\u2019t suffer as\u00a0these dual-band offerings will come into play.Furthering the conversation, the company has announced LTE-Advanced, leveling at more than 10Mbps 80% of the time; they\u2019ve managed to hit a 22% population coverage so far with this new technology. Again these speeds\u00a0don\u2019t meet up to standards of the world, as that speed should be easily\u00a0achievable on a 3G network. Remember that by , 4G LTE (alone) is supposed to reach 100Mbps for downloads, while on the move. Digi and other local telcos have a lot to do before being able to talk about 4G LTE as a whole, if they want to be taken seriously.Using their time wisely, Digi has added that they\u2019ve begun plans to roll-out VoWiFi in 2016, adding on to their earlier announcement about beginning VoLTE next year, as well. Tying it all together, the telco has begun a campaign on Twitter for their users to voice where they want new 4G LTE towers; once it wraps up within a month, the top 10 locations will get a cell tower put up \u2013 nope, they aren\u2019t kidding.It\u2019s sad to see the yellow coloured network provider list such low levels for 4G LTE (same goes for their supposed LTE-A). Taking a look at Maxis, who promise that their 4G LTE speeds exceed 15Mbps, at all hours, both indoor and outdoor. It isn\u2019t even a competition,when the latter\u00a0doesn\u2019t maintain this either but they can manage 5Mbps easily. Of course, the tell of the tale today is about coverage but how we see it is a company just plucking numbers from the air, actions that only earn them bragging rights \u2013 without third party verification.We\u2019d like to hear all your thoughts on the subject, as we\u2019ve addressed earlier all this coverage talk should hold no value for customers who suffer coverage outages, even in the Klang Valley. Please wake up telcos, your customers are sick of all this.

Well, if you want something more revolutionary, the boffins at Qeexo might just have what you need.Carnegie Mellon spin-off Qeexo have come up with a new algorithm that allows smartphones to recognise the angular position of a finger, and are hoping to change the way we interact with our devices.Dubbed the FingerAngle, this algorithm attempts to improve movements and interactions with a touch screen \u2013 like pinching or rotating \u2013 which require an extra finger to carry out properly. While on most modern smartphones, requiring an extra finger may not seem like that much of an inconvenience as screen real estate is ample. But when you need to perform those same actions on smaller screened devices like wearables, it becomes a little more tricky.FingerAngle though, changes this as it allows those devices to determine if you are rotating your finger, if your finger is tilted\u00a0upwards, downwards or even swiveled side to side. This software estimates a finger\u2019s 3D angle relative to a screen\u2019s surface by measuring the finger\u2019s pitch and yaw.This then opens up a whole new avenue of possibility for interacting with your device beyond just making it easier for wearables. One prominent possibility is in mobile gaming controls, where currently we have to use on-screen controls or rely on a device\u2019s accelerometer. With FingerAngle, the control possibilities have now completely opened up.FingerAngle\u2019s promotional video clearly shows that there are some kinks to work out, the latency for example, but as this isn\u2019t the final product yet, things are certainly looking good.Of course, this technology is still new and there is no definite timeline to when this software will\u00a0go live.

Users accused the social media site of being desensitised to the daily onslaught in the Middle East (e.g. Ankara and Beirut bombings); as such, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded by saying Facebook will enable this feature across the globe for future.This pivot in the industry could see more tech companies come to the aid of those affected, as their reach is truly global, and are limited only to the gadgets people carry around.

But if the were to arrive in Malaysia on the 19, we don\u2019t think they\u2019ll have one amazing gala, rather they\u2019d build up anticipation of their devices gradually.Skimming through SIRIM, if you\u2019d search for the model number RM-1116, the following information would be available to you:Saving you the trouble of digging through the spec-sheet, here\u2019s what to expect from the Lumia 950 XL; for starters, it\u2019ll carry a QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED 5.7-inch ClearBlack display, while on top you\u2019ll find Gorilla Glass 4 to protect it from abrasions.Running all processes, is a 2.0GHz\u00a0Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, together with 3GB of RAM and 32GBs of on-board memory. If that doesn\u2019t sit well with you, there\u2019s a microSD slot for expandability up to 200GB \u2013 but believe us, if you\u2019re going to be shooting 4K content, it\u2019ll be a life saver.The PureView camera is back and this time it\u2019s a 20-megapixel f/1.9 lens on the rear, equip with triple-LED RGB flash for less harsh illumination of your photos. You\u2019ll find optical image stabilisation on board as well, that will come in handy taking quick shots with the dedicated camera button.When recording those 4K videos, you\u2019ll be able to shoot up to 30fps and for audio quality, it\u2019ll be supported by the 4 microphones using Lumia\u2019s Rich Recording technology. Selfies on the other hand, will be taken with a 5-megapixel wide angle f/2.4 shooter, which allows Full HD video recording for video calls.To top it all off, it comes with a 3,340mAh battery and will give you Qi Wireless charging, if you prefer the no cable route.

Based on currency conversions you should expect the Lumia 950 XL to cost roughly RM 2,813 but obviously, no official prices have been announced.We\u2019ll keep you updated once we get official news from the manufacturer, regarding the Lumia devices.

Following the onslaught of who\u2019s the \u201cbest\u201d, \u201cwidest\u201d and \u201cfastest\u201d 4G LTE network, Maxis aims to put this issue to bed by releasing company data on how they classify their 4G LTE network. Moreover, the green coloured telco has also proposed to have a forum with two of its competitors to talk about the state of 4G LTE in Malaysia.Getting the ball rolling on a pressing issue that has left Malaysian baffled by both telcos claims (Digi and Maxis), this could mean that consumers will at the end gain more out of this. The initiator of all this has issued an open invitation to any member of the public to prove them wrong on their \u201cwidest\u201d 4G LTE network; they also hope Digi and Celcom follow suit.Setting the date for the 23 of November, Maxis hopes that this platform will allow all three networks to have their own telecommunications engineers to talk about how they gauge their coverage. And at the end of the day, Maxis claims that they want to do this for consumers; evidently to let us \u201chave a fair basis for choosing\u201d.Strangely, Maxis has left out the 4 major player in the market, U Mobile. Possibly since the company isn\u2019t publicly listed, otherwise we\u2019d best not speculate further. While everyone claims to provide the \u201cwidest\u201d 4G LTE, we\u2019re still questioning if they\u2019ve diverted their attention to problems that their customers are facing everyday \u2013 even in the heart of the Klang Valley.Our readers have been very open about their experiences on their networks, with some stating that there are service blind spots in popular landmarks and areas around the major cities. Silly if you think of it really, the fact that their customers in their key market areas are facing issues and they want to go on record being the \u201cwidest\u201d, \u201cfastest\u201d, and \u201cbest\u201d network.Previously, we talked about what all these bold titles mean to consumers, you can check it out . But if you\u2019re really into these figures that Maxis has published, they are listed below:It\u2019s easy to talk numbers and standards but do they really reflect in real-life situations? We\u2019ve tried testing Maxis\u2019 network at KLCC, on a weekday night and from the photo below, you can see we only managed 7Mbps download speeds, so what gives?We now throw it back to the telcos, step up your game, stop all the bickering and maintain your network coverage (and speed) across all your services \u2013 no matter 2G, 3G or 4G. We want a consistent experience, it doesn\u2019t matter to us if you\u2019re the widest if you can\u2019t deliver in reality.There has been no official statement from either Digi and Celcom yet (but be fair to them, it\u2019s a public holiday today). Once they\u2019ve replied we\u2019ll keep everyone updated. It\u2019ll be a great thing to see our cellular providers meet in a neutral setting, we hope that all three will decide to have an unbiased moderator and that the public will be allowed to grill them on their gripes.

On the other hand ,to\u00a0a timepiece aficionado the brand is usually the butt of jokes but its heritage is world-renown.

Somewhere\u00a0down the line, they\u2019ve lost their footing and are\u00a0trying\u00a0once again appeal to the wider consumer base. How can they turn it around with the  Connected?Jan-Claude Biver the CEO has officially announced how much this luxury watch will go for \u2013 setting you back a cool\u00a0US$ 1,500 (RM 6,581), this wearable better be worth the money. If you ask us personally, knowing that your buying a TAG at that price (even if it doesn\u2019t have the Swiss-made seal of approval) is a good deal; a quick run through some of their most affordable models and you\u2019ll see that the starting price hover around the US$ 1k mark.Obviously geared for a posher market, Mr Biver was quoted to say that it\u2019ll be similar to the , in terms of what it can do, though you shouldn\u2019t in any way compare the two together. \u201cI forbid my colleagues to say Apple is our competitor\u201d \u2013 as said by the CEO.The titanium built Carrera inspired Connected will run pretty much like other smartwatches by wirelessly connecting to your smartphone for a wide array of features. On your wrist this 46mm beast will be relatively large when compared to the biggest Apple Watch at 42mm. It might even be larger than the 46mm , as far as we can tell from photos.Ladies, if you\u2019re into the whole smart wearable luxury segment (if that existed prior to this \u2013 no we aren\u2019t gonna bother comparing to\u00a0the US$ 17,000 Apple Watch), the Swiss makers have plans to fashion a smaller version in the future.

Keep in mind that Carreras retail way over US$ 3,000, a worthy bargain if you have the cash to splash.Running on the  platform, you\u2019ll have access to some special watch faces and some dedicated apps to help you with dining options and golf tracking. It\u2019s has a 1.5-inch LCD sapphire glass screen at 360 x 360 resolution and come with 4GB of internal storage. Paying a pretty penny for this smartwatch, it leaves out an important piece that you\u2019d expect to get for its price; an optical heart-rate sensor.Considering you aren\u2019t too bummed out, it does however house a gyroscope, tilt detection sensor, microphone, haptic engine and a 410 mAh battery (that TAG Heuer promises will get you 30 hours of battery-life). With Intel-inside, it\u2019ll run a 1.6GHz dual-core Atom processor mated to 1GB of RAM. For connectivity, there\u2019s Wi-Fi (B/G/N) and Bluetooth 4.0 to pair with your iOS 8 (or higher) device or at least an Android running version 4.3 (and up).Big tech giants  and  both had some part in creating the smartwatch, proving that it could be a formidable time piece.

Most recently,  owners have taken to reddit to voice their concerns and experiences with the device. As we all know, the latest Nexus has glass on the back (a very small part) for its rear camera and other sensors. But what you wouldn\u2019t expect is the rear glass panel suddenly cracking for no reason.First encountered by a reddit user by the name \u201cjonny_rat\u201d, the owner recalls his experience, thus raising some huge concerns about how \u00a0went into making these panels.

Measuring just 3mm thin, you\u2019re likely to notice a bump but not by much.

There\u2019s also a discreet function to avoid certain interruptions by prioritising the contacts you\u2019ve managed. Inside the disc lives an optical heart rate sensor and accelerometer\u00a0to support\u00a0your fitness lifestyle by enabling advanced tracking for exercise on the dedicated app.Other features included are multimedia controls for apps like SONOS, iTunes and Spotify by taping from the top, bottom, left and right \u2013 each functioning differently and acting as a remote control of sorts. Lastly, it\u2019ll also act as a wireless picture taking controller; up to 25 feet away, a simple tap will start a countdown timer and after 3 seconds a photo is taken.Hypo allergenic in nature and water resistant, the manufacturer promises the device will give you up to 4 days of battery life. Currently, it supports iPhone 5\u2019s (and up) on iOS 8 or later, as well as Android smartphones that run at least 4.2 (and up).There will be two versions of the Trivoly, as the low end variant doesn\u2019t have the fitness tracker component.

This new powerhouse is likely to debut on their upcoming . Announced at Beijing today, the Kirin 950 is set to be a game changer. It is manufactured based on a 16nm fab process and it uses 4x high performance ARM Cortex A72 cores that are clocked up to 2.3GHz that\u2019s accompanied by 4x low power Cortex A53 cores at 1.8GHz.

{"text": "Huawei is certainly a brand to watch out for as they are rising to the occasion with some compelling smart phones these days. On the Huawei P8, they had elevated their build quality perceptions with a premium unibody metal design, but it isn\u2019t as refined as its mainstream rivals. Perception isn\u2019t built overnight but more consumers are beginning to accept the new wave of alternatives coming from China.To show the world what they are capable of, Huawei had recently announced the , a premium device that eyes for the likes of the Galaxy Note 5 and the iPhone 6S Plus. Can they deliver? Read on to find out.At first glance, it looks like a bigger honor 7 with a full metal back that comes with a subtle curve. Upon picking it up, you\u2019ll notice the finer details and the silky smooth surfaces that are nice to touch. Their previous P8 flagship was solid in the hands but the Mate S adds more refinement to the mix. At 7.2mm thin, it is slightly thicker than an iPhone 6s at the thickest point, but the sloping back gives a thinner feeling device at your fingertips. Looking towards the bottom, it shares the similar design as the Huawei P8 and the honor 7, with twin speaker/mic grills on each side of the micro USB port. On the left, you\u2019ll find a dual-SIM tray slot, which is a hybrid one that accepts microSD.The volume buttons and power button are neatly placed on the right for easy reach but we felt that the power button could be larger for the perfect feel. The 5.5\u2033 Full HD screen dominates the front with minimal clutter as it uses on-screen buttons for navigation. During its global launch, the Mate S was Huawei\u2019s first smart phone to feature a \u201cForce Touch\u201d display that\u2019s pressure sensitive but it isn\u2019t present in our current unit. That apparently it reserved for its higher-spec model that comes with 128GB of storage.Underneath, the Huawei Mate S shares a lot of similarities with the honor 7. It runs on a high-end Kirin 935 Octa-Core 64-bit processor (2.2GHz x4, 1.5GHz x4) that\u2019s mated to 3GB of RAM. On-board the mate S comes with 64GB of storage for Malaysia and it is expandable up to 128GB using microSD. With EMUI 3.1 that runs on top of Android 5.1.1, it runs rather smoothly without any hesitation so far.For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP camera with a 4-colour RGBW sensor that\u2019s assisted by dual-LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation. Similar to the P8, it gets a variety of modes including Light Painting features. The Mate S gets a new Professional Mode that offers full manual settings for extra tweaks on ISO, Manual Focus, Exposure and AWB.For taking selfies, the front gets a 8MP camera that even comes with a soft flash light for brighter looking selfies. Despite being a 2015 flagship, the main camera doesn\u2019t support 4K videos, shooting a maximum of up to Full HD 1080p.The single down facing speaker is quite loud but the biggest feature for audio has got to be its recording capabilities. The Mate S has 3 mics in total which can be used simultaneously to record a meeting conversation with individual attendee tagging, similar to the Galaxy Note 4. In the battery department, it packs a 2,700mAh capacity unit which is slightly more than the P8 by a slight margin.Unlocking the Mate S is rather quick with its rear mounted fingerprint scanner. It unlocks instantly with a touch and it does more than just securing the device. Similar to the honor 7, you can swipe downwards to view notification. On top of that, it performs double duty as a touch pad scroller in the image gallery as well as a remote trigger when taking pictures using both main and selfie cameras.Despite not having a pressure sensitive display, the Mate S still gets a decent amount of gesture features. Apart from the usual tap to wake, it has an improve Knuckle Sense technology that lets you screen capture or crop using your knuckles. Huawei has improved it further with a quick app launch feature where you can draw a \u201cc\u201d using your knuckle to launch the camera or \u201ce\u201d to open a browser.At RM2,698, the Huawei Mate S is also the most expensive smart phone and it goes neck to neck with the Galaxy Note5 that\u2019s priced at RM2,699. For a quick comparison, the Mate S has the upper hand with double the storage at 64GB along with the option to add more with a microSD slot. However the Note5 offers more in specs including a faster processor, more RAM, faster camera and also a productive S Pen. If performance and productivity is what you\u2019re looking for, it is tough to recommend the Mate S over the Galaxy Note5. The decision is even tougher considering the similar spec\u2019ed albeit the smaller screen honor 7 can be have for just RM1,399. However if you\u2019re looking for a stylish and premium alternative that isn\u2019t a Samsung or an Apple, the Mate S could be something worth checking out.", "id": "395"},

It supports RAW shooting with one touch enhancement and there\u2019s also a hyperlapse feature to speed up or slow down your action videos. At the front, it still retains HTC\u2019s 4MP f/2.0 Ultrapixel unit for brighter selfies in low light conditions.Despite its shortfall on external speakers, the One A9 compensates by having a HiFi DAC built-in. This delivers 24-bit/192KHz Hi-Res Audio with Dolby Audio\u2122 Surround technology for better enjoyment with some quality headphones plugged-in. On top of that, the One A9 runs on the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box and HTC pledges to update the software within 15 days after the Nexus lineup gets them. In typical HTC fashion, it gets a smaller than average battery at 2,150mAh that supports Quick Charge 2.0. On the spec sheet, it mentions that  will be compatible once it is available officially.

This minor annoyance has been fixed with the new iOS 9.1 which is rolling out now to current iOS 9 devices.

So what makes the  worth RM 2,698 (w/ GST)?The Mate S was marketed\u00a0during its launch to feature  on its 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, but sadly\u00a0we aren\u2019t getting that model locally (yet?). So what gives? Why the premium price tag that could almost have anyone easily pick up TWO 16GB s? More so when it looks almost identical despite some contrasting characteristics.Under all that premium metal sits a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM and if those words ring a bell, you\u2019re right if you said that it\u2019s the exact same combo found on the honor 7.

{"text": "With the  and  out of the way, Samsung is undoubtedly working full force on next year\u2019s flagship, the Galaxy S7. At the moment, Samsung is leading the Android pack, with benchmark crushing performance and finally a premium build utilising metal and glass materials.So what will Samsung do next for the first half of 2016? Based on what we\u2019ve heard so far, they are introducing a couple of new features to widen its gap against its competitors. For starters, the Galaxy S7 is expected to use USB Type C, a reversible cable connector that\u2019s supposedly a future standard. Not only it allows faster rapid charge, it also provides faster data transfers even when compared to USB 3.0. New flagships like the OnePlus 2, Lumia 950/950XL and Nexus 5X/6P have already adopted this connector standard and we should be seeing more of these in 2016. The  has it and so does the latest . It was recently revealed that Samsung has patented a  that\u2019s similar to 3D Touch. This allows it to differentiate the amount of force being applied onto the screen, based on corresponding voltage. From the illustrations above, the feature allows multi purpose input such as alternating between space/tab and apply upper case when a key is pressed with extra force. It is possible that Samsung might introduce this on their future flagships, and it may or may not be the Galaxy S7. The Exynos 7420 processor on the Galaxy S6/Note5 is a proven workhorse, churning out insane benchmark figures yet maintaining frugal battery consumption. For next year, Samsung is rumoured to release the Galaxy S7 with up to  variants. The Exynos 7422 which was earlier rumoured for the Galaxy Note5 will is expected to power India based units while a newer Exynos 8890 (also known as the Exynos M1) will find its way to Korea, Japan and European markets. Given a pass for Samsung\u2019s 2015 flagships, Qualcomm appears to be making a come back with a Snapdragon 820 processor. The Snapdragon 820 variant is said to be fitted for China and US bound units. So far there\u2019s no mention of what we\u2019re getting in the South East Asian region. For imaging, the 16MP shooter on the Galaxy Note5/S6 remains unchanged since the Galaxy Note 4. To bring its photography capabilities to the next level, Samsung could be upgrading to a higher 20MP camera that utilises Samsung\u2019s own ISOCELL sensor. Word also has it that it could carry a dual-camera set up, similar to the HTC One M9+.With the Apple iPhone 6s/6s Plus being announced in September, Samsung had brought forward its Galaxy Note5 launch to August, ahead of its traditional September IFA launch. This gave Samsung an early head start to build up its sales momentum before the iDevices go to market. For 2016, it appears that Samsung might announce the Galaxy S7 as early as January instead of its usual February/March timeline in conjunction with Mobile World Congress. Similar to its current Galaxy S6, there would be two models \u2013 SM-G930 and SM-G935 which carry a standard and a dual-curved display. January is just 3 months away. So if you\u2019re planning to get a new flagship smart phone, would you just grab the Galaxy Note5 or wait for the next big thing?[ , ,  ]", "id": "417"},

For the home users that may require some portable usage, the Aspire Z3 all-in-one is an interesting concept. With 17.3\u2033 Full HD display and weighing just 2kg, this is an all-in-one desktop that can be carried away as a tablet. It even works without a direct power source with an in-built battery that\u2019s rated to last up to 5 hours.

{"text": "Today marks a change at TM with a new website and refresh of its high speed broadband offering. Branding wise, the Unifi logo remains unchanged since its inception but its online presence has been revamped with a store-like design for easier online application. With calls for faster and cheaper broadband, TM has revised its broadband offering with its new Unifi ADVANCE PLAN which claims to pack the best value in the industry.For starters, the new Unifi home plans come in just 2 options \u2013 30Mbps and 50Mbps. This essentially is the same \u201cnew\u201d plans  but with reduced subscription fees. The TM Unifi ADVANCE PLAN with 30Mbps is offered at RM179/month instead of RM199/month, and if you need 50Mbps, it can be yours for RM229/month (before GST).By default, you get HyppTV as standard which comes with HyppTV Aneka or HyppTV Varnam Pack for free. You also get a DECT Phone bundled in but calls are now charged separately at 20 sen/min to all local numbers including mobile. For those needing unlimited calls to fixed lines like its former VIP plans, you can opt for the Voice Pack that costs RM20/month. In terms of speed, the 30Mbps plan gives you 30Mbps download while uploads are at 5Mbps. For RM50/month extra, you get 50Mbps download with a faster uplink of 10Mbps. So if you\u2019re an existing VIP 10 customer enjoying 10Mbps for both download and upload, your next upgrade should be the ADVANCE PLAN with 50Mbps download and 10Mbps. Essentially you\u2019re getting 5x the download speed while the upload speed remains unchanged. TM insists that its Unifi packages are competitively priced against its competitors. With Maxis jumping onto the fibre broadband business, it had caused a stir with its cheaper 10Mbps offering from as low as RM128/month. When compared on the same speed of 30Mbps, Unifi appears to pack more value considering it includes HyppTV and you get a fixed line with the option for unlimited calls at RM20/month.For enterprise users, they have a similar offering with its Unifi BIZ ADVANCE PLAN. The base 30Mbps plan with Dynamic IP starts at RM259/month (Normal: RM299/month) and you have the option to upgrade to 50Mbps at RM50/month extra. There\u2019s also Simple Voice Plus Plan for free fixed line calls at RM30/month and there are more add-ons for MS Office, POS systems and surveillance services. Like the Home plans, the 30Mbps offering comes with 5Mbps upload while the 50Mbps option gets 10Mbps upload. Strangely TM has removed its lower 5Mbps, 10Mbps and 20Mbps Unifi packages of old. While the new Unifi ADVANCE PLANS might offer higher speeds for less, it doesn\u2019t really address the concerns of affordable broadband. When we did a , it seems that the 30Mbps/50Mbps plans have limited coverage areas and if you\u2019re not covered, it suggests that you take up Streamyx instead. Perhaps they should consider introducing a cheaper 5Mbps option without the extra bells and whistles instead.For more information, head over to the new .", "id": "439"},
{"text": "Another year and another iPhone has finally arrived. The  will be available in Malaysia officially this Friday, 16th October at 12:00AM. If you\u2019re looking to buy one on contract, it is available from all 4 telcos namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. This is the fastest iPhone 6s roll out yet for Malaysia and it is also the most extensive in terms of contract options.With U Mobile coming into the picture, they have shaken things up a little with its lower commitment plans and an interesting Microcredit financing option. For Maxis, it still retains the same iValue Plan offering that comes with bundled calls, text and SMS. However for those who make lots of phone calls, they are also making its MaxisONE Plan available as well. Celcom on the other hand has the simplest approach with just 3 FIRST plan options that come with its OPTIMISER feature. Last but not least is Digi where they are bundling the iPhone 6s with their new SmartPlan that can be have with either more data or more voice and SMS. In terms of contract duration, majority of the plans are on 24 months with exception for Maxis and Digi where they do have 12 months option for selected plans. So which telco should you go for? We\u2019ve gathered the plans and device pricing from all 4 telcos for your easy reference. Check them out after the break.For consistency, we compared the permanent non-promo bundles from each plan with its pricing without the 6% GST. Do note that the above minimum cost of ownership is just a guide and it is based on the assumption that you don\u2019t incur additional usage on top of what has been included with the plan. On Maxis, they are giving 1GB extra for 6 months on its highest MaxisOne 188 plan. On top of that, they are also giving  of additional 1GB for 4G LTE use only for the MaxisONE Plan as well. Digi on the other hand is giving 2GB of extra data for 12 months in conjunction with its current . Following closely behind is Celcom where they are giving 1GB extra of free data for 12 months. During sign up, most of these telcos would require an upfront payment, which is basically like a deposit that would be used to offset your upcoming bills. For U Mobile, they do offer a waiver for the advance payment but you\u2019ll need to pay the device by credit card and sign up for their auto-debit billing feature. Before committing to a plan on contract, it is always recommended to pick one that suits your needs. The iPhone 6s is obviously cheaper on the highest plan and you might end up paying more than what you actually need. Apart from the calls, SMS and data offering, there are other things to consider such as network quality, customer service and other value added services including international roaming. For those who can\u2019t afford to pay so much upfront, U Mobile offers the flexibility with Microcredit which you can determine its duration and amount. However do note that this works like a personal loan and there\u2019s an interest of approximately 1.2%. As usual, if you spot any errors in the table above, do let us know in the comments above.Considering the iPhone is more expensive than before, getting one with a telco contract would garner more savings provided that you get the right plan. However for those who prefer to get it outright, an iPhone 6s is  from RM3,199 for the base 16GB model. Below is the full iPhone pricelist in Malaysia right now:", "id": "440"},

For U Mobile, they are offering  but it gets more generous quotas and greater flexibility to make owning an iPhone 6s easier. Could this be the best iPhone 6s deal in town? Read on to find out.For starters, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are offered with their iPlans, offering Voice, SMS and data all-in in either postpaid or prepaid. The lowest option is their i40 plan that comes with 1.5GB of data, 40 minutes of calls and 20 SMS to all networks for just RM40/month. If you commit RM20/month extra on i60, you\u2019ll get 5GB of data, 60 minutes of calls and 30 SMS.

This is probably the closest plan to their recent  offering. Overall, U Mobile appears to be the most generous with data among the 4 participating telcos. If you have an existing device, you can  hassle free with U Mobile and they are accepting as high as RM1,900 for an iPhone 6 Plus. On top of that, all trade-ups to an iPhone 6s will enjoy extra savings with an additional RM100 rebate.  In terms of device, the subsidised iPhone 6s pricing on U Mobile are as follows (inclusive 6% GST):During sign up, there\u2019s an advance payment which is rebated back across 24 months. However this can be waived if you pay the device by credit card and sign up for auto debit billing facility. There\u2019s also a  with participating credit cards.

However you\u2019ll either lose the remaining rebates if you\u2019ve paid advance payment and for those who didn\u2019t, will need to pay back the pro-rated subsidy of the device.

OnePlus\u2019 newest smartphone is apparently its take on a more aesthetically pleasing product, not its usual \u201cFlagship Killer\u201d motive.What we can confirm so far is that the new One E1003 will only support Wi-Fi bands from a/g/n omitting the best \u201cac\u201d support out.

While its price might draw conclusions that it\u2019ll less than worthy spec device, it surprises by supposedly running a MediaTek Helio X10 processor, coupled with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM.Its screen is reported to be a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and the storage appears to be 32GB internally, and it\u2019ll have a microSD slot \u2013 a first for the OnePlus lineup. Tuned up with a polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass the edges will taper smoothly, hoping translating to better ergonomics.Somewhere under the hood, its purported that there will be at least 3,000/3,100 mAh powering the new smartphone. Straying a bit from the OnePlus 2, the Mini is claimed anonymously to carry NFC, an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and the familiar USB Type-C that supports fast charge.Camera-wise it allegedly showcases a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor, supporting video up until 4K if you\u2019re into the whole pixel game.

It also adds on 14grams of extra heft at 143 grams for the iPhone 6s and 20grams on the iPhone 6s Plus at 192g.Stacking the phones side by side, you\u2019ll see a 4.7-inch (iPhone 6s) and 5.5-inch (iPhone 6s Plus) Retina Display \u2013 the same on the older 6 and 6 Plus smartphones. Under the hood, there\u2019s a 64-bit enabled A9 chip that has a 70% increase in performance over the A8 processor.Performance is multiplied by integrating the M9 motion co-processor onto the A9 chip, saving some space internally as well at the same time. Taking a look at its battery, in actual fact the capacity decreases but in real-life situation it still maintains the same battery life with stronger power efficiency in iOS. For its colour options, Apple now adds a Rose Gold variant that is probably aimed to draw in the more feminine high-class crowd.Storage of these two devices remain the same at 16GB, 64GB and 128GB, a hard-case to justify why Apple doesn\u2019t raise their bare minimum to 32GB but people will likely accept it.The prices below are , whose\u2019 pre-order page went live before 12 midnight.

Gentle taps, long presses and hard presses bring up new options \u2013\u00a0allowing users to do more with the same device.Doubling the iSIght camera on their new duo, both of them get bumped up to 12-megapixels with f/2.2 aperture, at the same time it also gets dual-tone LED flash for a more natural looking flash. The big brother in the form of the 6s Plus does have an upper hand in the camera department, as Apple has added Optical Image Stabilisation. On the front however, the old 1.2-megapixel sensor is replaced by a 5-megapixel shutter with f/2.2 aperture and adding the new Retina Flash to brighten up your selfies.Apple has prepared their new iPhones\u2019 by adding more pixels to their sensors but how well will the devices stack up against the other camera smartphones in our latest  between the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s Plus, LG G4 and Samsung Note5.There are a wide array of features and other specifications on the pair of Apple devices, for more info you can head over .[  ]", "id": "457"},

The Lumia 950 and 950 XL aren\u2019t just about the latest hardware but a more integrated experience with its family of products. One notable feature is how it transforms the smart phone to deliver a PC-like experience via Windows Continuum. This is better implemented than other smart phone to PC docks we\u2019ve seen before.Going through the specs, there\u2019s no surprises from what we\u2019ve seen in . Both the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL come with a Quad HD AMOLED ClearBlack display that are 5.2\u2033 and 5.7\u2033 respectively. These are the highest resolution smart phones Microsoft has ever made with over 500ppi in pixel density. The Lumia 950 XL gets Gorilla Glass 4 protection while the Lumia 950 settles for Gorilla Glass 3. Under the hood, the 950 XL gets Qualcomm\u2019s 2.0GHz Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor while the 950 gets a 1.8GHz Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 unit. Both of which comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. Should you need more especially when shooting 4K videos, there\u2019s a microSD slot which supports 200GB.

Like most new high-end devices, it shoots 4K videos in 30fps while audio is is captured with Lumia Rich Recording that uses 4 microphones.

As one of the pioneers of wireless charging on a smart phone, it still supports native Qi Wireless charging for both models. If you decide to juice up the old school way, Microsoft is future-proofing its Lumia 950/950 XL with USB Type C that supports fast charging. During the presentation, they shared that a 50% charge can be accomplished in just 30 minutes.Connectivity wise, both ticked the right boxes with faster 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. Which ever model you pick, there\u2019s also a dual-SIM variant but it is subject to each respective market. Another new feature is its Windows Hello biometric authentication feature. The actual workings behind it wasn\u2019t explained clearly but the product demo looks similar to Android\u2019s Face Unlock with the use of its front camera. Earlier rumours suggest an Iris recognition technology that\u2019s assisted by IR light.Probably one of the coolest feature is Windows Continuum.

Microsoft wants you to destroy limits with their new wearable, stated for individuals who want to be in a better state of health and just get more things done.Microsoft\u2019s first band was packed with features but failed to be something people would want on their wrist, partly cause of its design; often compared to be clunky and simply too cumbersome to be a daily wearable. Consumers should now be happier, cause Microsoft listened and their engineers in Redmond took more time to design the Band 2 to be more ergonomic. A word that you\u2019d first expect to hear when wearables are concerned. Now curvier than ever, its Gorilla glass display tears at an angle!

Golfers will surely ravel at the sensors and functionality included; distances measured from the tee to the hole and swing mechanics to help those drives just to name a few.It\u2019ll help you track other stuff too with its 8 other sensors.

The new Surface Pro 4 marks its 4th generation of its 2-in-1 tablet/laptop convergence device and it runs on the very latest Windows 10. The current Surface Pro 3 to us is a breakthrough as it offers a full Windows experience in a true tablet form. It did live up to its \u201cTablet that could replace your Laptop\u201d claim and the new one just raises the bar to a whole new level. Size does matter and we\u2019ve seen countless of 2-in-1 devices that are just too heavy for tablet use. The Surface Pro 4 now gets a larger 12.3\u2033 display that does a higher 2736\u00d71824 pixels resolution while maintaining the same footprint of 292.1mm x 201.42mm. As comparison, the Surface Pro 3 has a 12\u2033 screen that pushes 2160\u00d71440 pixels resolution. On top of that, Microsoft has made it even thinner at 8.45mm (Surface Pro 3: 9.1mm) and lighter from 766 grams (Surface Pro 3: 800g). The front still gets a pair of stereo speakers and microphones while the top gets a 5MP front camera. Over at the rear, the camera gets bumped up to 8MP and it comes with auto focus. You still get a full sized USB 3.0, microSD card reader, headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort, all encased in its Magnesium body that comes in Silver. In the current Surface Pro 3, Microsoft had introduced a variety of Intel Core processors with various memory and storage options to suit every need. For the Surface Pro 4, the list is even more extensive with the latest 6th generation Intel Core processors. At the base level, they have opt for an Intel Core m3 processor instead of the usual i3 with a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage. For those who demand more power and have a loads of cash to burn, you can opt for the highest Core i7 processor with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Performance wise, the Surface Pro 4 is reported to be 30% faster than the Surface Pro 3 and 50% faster than the competing MacBook Air. No doubt it drives the price up to exorbitant levels and this is made worse with our current exchange rate. The full pricing for the Surface Pro 4 are as follows:Moving on to what makes the Surface Pro 4 a laptop replacement is the keyboard. The new Surface Pro 4 Type Cover has been massively improved to provide a better laptop class experience and it is thinner than before. The keys have been redesigned with larger spacing in between like a laptop chiclet keyboard which is made quieter and comfortable to type on.The trackpad meanwhile is 40% larger and it comes with a glass surface that tracks 5 multi-touch points. If you\u2019re using a Surface Pro 3, good news for you as the new keyboard is compatible as well. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is priced at US$129.99 which is about RM554.With more players getting their hands onto styluses, Microsoft had introduced a newer Surface Pen. It boasts 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity (current Surface Pen: 256 levels) and it even comes with an eraser at the back. This replaces the secondary button on the sides, leaving just one for right clicking, while the eraser tip still doubles as a Magic Button which launches OneNote on a single click. For the right feel and shade, there are interchangeable Pen Tips where you can swap from 2H, H, HB and B tips. It still connects via Bluetooth and with a AAAA battery, the new Surface Pen still lasts a whole year without charging needed in between. For storage, the Surface Pen now clips onto the slides of the Surface Pro 4 with the help of magnets. It sounds like a good solution but we\u2019re not sure if it could hold on well with clumsy hands.  Overall, the Surface Pro 4 is thinner, lighter, faster and massively improved to steer you away from the traditional laptop. For those who work on the lap a lot, we are still unconvinced with the practicality of the kick stand but it is perfect when it\u2019s used on the table. With the price tag of US$999 for the minimum Core i5 model, it is quite expensive compared to other similarly equipped laptops. If budget permits, this is still the best 2in1 hybrid tablet/laptop out there and it is more practical than Apple\u2019s .

That plus the 23-megapixel sensor that captures 5520 x 4120 resolution images, while its video capabilities range from 2160p/30fps down to 720p/120fps. Sony\u2019s thrown in the regular bells and whistles too, with its phase-detection autofocus technology, LED flash, and HDR.Looks like more camera shootout comparisons will be coming your way, if this is anything to lead on. Impressively the Nexus 6P could appear out of nowhere as well, since DxOMark lists them at the current number two spot. LG and Samsung better watch out, cause these devices are potentially going to knock them off the podium.Here\u2019s a breakdown at how the Xperia Z5 performed during the testing. \u00a0[  ]", "id": "470"},
{"text": "For those who can\u2019t seem to get enough mobile internet for their smart phones, this could be music to your ears. Celcom has introduced its new FIRST Basic 85 Internet Plan which gives you 21GB of mobile data for only RM85/month. Although it sounds the same, this isn\u2019t the same as the standard  that comes with an OPTIMISER feature. Instead, this is a data-centric plan that gives you loads of data while calls are only charged when you need it.For RM85/month, by default it comes with 7GB of mobile data and 7GB of Celcom WiFi (if you could find one) that\u2019s usable anytime of the day. The remaining 14GB of data (plus 14GB of Celcom WiFi) is allocated only for off-peak hours between 2AM and 8AM daily. According to the , unused internet can be carried forward with a maximum of 7GB to the following month and this is only from your 24 hour data bucket. Once you\u2019ve finished your internet allocation, speeds will be throttled to 64kbps and there\u2019s a limit of 15GB per billing cycle.If you need more data at full speeds, you can top up from as little as RM3 for 100MB, or you can opt for more at RM15/GB and RM50 for 5GB. As for calls, it isn\u2019t specified clearly but SMS and MMS are charged at 15 sen to all networks. Interestingly if you\u2019ve finished your FIRST Basic 85 Internet allocation, all calls and SMS are charged at 10sen. Come to think of it, this is basically Celcom\u2019s  with voice and you can sign up without the unnecessary activation and registration fee. Should you get this over the standard Celcom FIRST Basic 85? If you use more than 5GB a month and hardly make any calls, the answer is probably yes. As comparison, the standard FIRST Basic 85  gives you 5GB of internet, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS for the heavy internet user. Alternative those who talk a lot will get 2GB of internet plus 600 minutes of calls and 600 SMS each month.If you\u2019re interested, this plan is available from now until 31st October and take note that it comes with a 12 months contract.

The device isn\u2019t a one trick-pony, considering it boasts some decent specs to go along with its \u201cforce touch\u201d technology. Housed inside the all metal-chasis, is a home-grown Kirin 935 8-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM, all in a 5.5-inch package.Its screen is a FHD display (1920 x 1080) and has curves on the back that tee off slightly, while the front makes use of 2.5D Gorrila Glass 4 to smooth the edges. There are two variants of the devices but the model listed on SIRIM is the CRR-UL00 model which comes with dual-SIM and has a different band support. It also supports 4G LTE in either FDD and TDD standards. But as a rough indication, the UK  site is selling the 32GB version at \u00a3469.00, instead of its larger 64GB model. Based on  in the UK, the Mate S in \u201cStandard version\u201d doesn\u2019t come with the pressure sensitive display and it is said to be available later in a high-spec trim with 128GB of storage. So it is still a question mark whether we are getting the \u201cForce Touch\u201d high-spec version in Malaysia.In terms of its imaging, a 13-megapixel camera will support its photo taking on the rear, while the front gets a 8-megapixel shooter. The former is an f/2.0 4-colour RGBW camera sensor with OIS and dual-LED flash. On the latter, its an f/2.4 shooter with an accompanying soft LED light for flash.Fans of gestures will ravel over the (for show) Knuckle sense technology. An upgraded 2.0 version allows you to draw a \u201cC\u201d shape to open the camera app \u2013 we\u2019re unsure how many of you will take notice or even use this though. The metal-chasis on the back surrounds a distinctive Huawei shaped fingerprint sensor. From Apple to Samsung, the Mate S also shares the 3 microphone multi way conference recording feature as seen on the Galaxy Note 4.A feather weight of sorts at 156grams and 7.2mm thick, it still manages to pack a 2,700 mAh battery under all that metal. Android 5.1 will run the device\u2019s OS but have a EMUI 3.1 skin to go on top.

But it certainly isn\u2019t cheap because\u00a0native isn\u2019t easy to find. Sony\u2019s latest statement answers some questions but we\u2019ll have to see how well it attempts to levitate this problem.What the Japanese manufacturer attempts to do is downgrade non-4K content to a more reasonable 1080p, although it won\u2019t sacrifice any proper 4K content, ensuring you\u2019ll still get the most pixels. Here\u2019s a snippet of what Sony said:They then offer an explanation as for why they decided to do so:It\u2019s great that Sony has chosen to address these concerns and the reasons listed do make sense.

At least it runs Android Lollipop out of the box and is ready to resist dust and water, rated at IP67-certified, albeit having an exposed micro-USB port .

Protected by sapphire crystal it boasts an f/2.2 aperture and a dual-LED module sits on the left of the main sensor.Selfie taking individuals will be pleased as on the front you\u2019ll see a 13-megapixel shutter with a BSI sensor. In terms of aperture, the front lens steps it up a bit with an f/2.0 lens instead. If you prefer videos, the rear sensor gets you 4K quality and the front is capable of 1080p films.Aesthetically, the Boomsound speaker grills are slightly thinner this time around, giving it a sleaker look but still maintaining its large bezels on the top and bottom.

The function is pretty similar to what\u2019s already on\u00a0the latest devices.The device also comes with three coloured filters that you use by attaching to the face of the Lolliflash that adjusts the lighting tone. Said filters come in Blue, White and Pink and each enhances the lighting in its own way. It even charges via a tiny microUSB port at the back and has about three hours worth of battery life with continuous use.The Lolliflash doesn\u2019t actually sync to your phone so you can essentially use it with any device that has a headphone jack, so you don\u2019t need to pair it with an ASUS device to work.So would you the Asus Lolliflash? tell us in the comments below.", "id": "488"},

A selling strategy that conjured up to ensure that they sell products at an extremely small profit margin. Their stint so far has proven that while people really want to buy their devices, they can\u2019t keep up with the demand. So much so till it has driven Carl Pei to ask Samsung for an internship position, so he\u2019ll be able to learn about being a bigger name in the market.The Shenzen based company, has faced a lot of hurdles since coming to existence in December 2013. They\u2019ve suffered immense pressure to keep up the supply chain, and even daring to declare themselves as the \u201c2016 Flagship Killer\u201d. Maybe Mr Pei\u2019s intentions of heading to Samsung would be to see how they incorporate Fast Charging in their devices; considering OnePlus didn\u2019t include any form of the technology in their 2 devices or perhaps get some insider info on how to kill Samsung\u2019s flagship in 2016.He\u2019s even gone on record on his personal blog, stating that since the OnePlus 2, he\u2019s learned important lessons from not meeting demands of orders. Adding that the company is working overtime just to get their newest device into the hands of their owners.It\u2019s a given really when you intend to have a \u201cone-hour open sale\u201d that caused those on the invite-list to go mad \u2013 why have an open sale when you can\u2019t even sell to those already waiting. We\u2019re still not sure if they have a proper team handling marketing but at least they\u2019ve set out to disrupt the market. Tipping the scales in favour of the consumer, so we\u2019ll have to give lift our hats in that aspect.If the industry evolves, there\u2019s likely room for more competition amongst the respective manufacturers \u2013 loosely quoting Carl Pei. But this is when it takes the cake, he goes on to say :-We\u2019ll let you be the judge if this is an honest attempt at reaching out or just another stunt that could lead the brand further down the rabbit hole. Subsequently, the guys at Android Authority managed to dig up Pei\u2019s LinkedIn account, which shows that the Co-founder has been around. Take a look at the photo below. kids could offer Carl some insights on how to successfully get an internship opportunity at Samsung.

{"text": "Laptops, 2-in-1s, Surfaces\u2019 and iPad Pros, what do they all have in common? They\u2019re more productive than regular mobile devices; the commonality? A keyboard. Yes, the way we type dictate how productive we are, or at least for the time being.So since we\u2019ve seen that drafting long-winded text has always been a headache-inducing experience; hence, Google has reworked their existing Pixel brand to encase a new screen and bluetooth keyboard combination in the form of the Pixel C(onvertible).Could this be a direct answer to the dwindling tablet sales? Convergence devices have a chance to occupy some market share and it seems that most manufacturers are coming up with some sort of variation to tackle this problem.Omitting kickstands and clasps, yet maintaining its rigidity, the device attempts to be a tablet but combining the keyboard through magnets allows you to immediately start your full-on typing jobs. Adjustable to angles from 100 to 135 degrees, when attached, the presentation showed that you can handle it in an array of angles, not coming apart even without being grounded.As an add-on, the bluetooth linked keyboard decreases pitch of the key size from the regular keyboard\u2019s 19mm (13-inch), to the Pixel C\u2019s 18.8mm pitch; the size of keys center to center from each other. It also features a 1.4mm key travel, so typing won\u2019t be too annoying. Stowing the typing add-on is easy, simply placing it under the tablet. Battery-wise it charges inductively when closed through the tablet itself, and a few minutes a day will keep the small keyboard\u2019s battery fully charged, otherwise the keyboard will last for roughly 2 months.In terms of the tablet\u2019s internals, it pushes a 2560 x 1800 pixel resolution through its aforementioned 10.2-inch screen that\u2019s capable of 500 nits of brightness. Running the engine is a quad-core Nvidia Tegra X1 processor with a Maxwell GPU, mated with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage options are available in two choices; 32GB and 64GB.You\u2019ll charge the new Google device through the USB Type-C port, and it has a nifty way of showing the battery percentage, just tap twice on the light bar and it\u2019ll show you a gauge of the current percentage. As for software, it\u2019ll run Android OS leaving out ChromeOS out in the cold.Beckoning the question \u2013 are they going to market this solely as a combo? Or will they let the tablet do most of the talking? As is, Android tablets have already had third-party options that allow users to add-on a keyboard, so this is nothing spectacularly new from Google.Some details have been left-out for the time being \u2013 like the camera optics, type of screen, and battery size but more info will likely be released at a later date to keep anticipation high.The device today was just teased and Google hopes to release the device by the holiday season. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t withhold pricing and they\u2019ve announced it\u2019ll cost you $499/RM 2,211 (32GB), $599/RM 2,654 (64GB) and $149/RM 660 for the bluetooth keyboard add-on. Google has set up a product page but for now its really bare bones, you can check it out .Here\u2019s the Google Keynote below (skip over to 1:11:28 for the Pixel C)", "id": "490"},

The new Mi Piston 3.0 is totally redesigned and gone is the metal chambers that usually come in gold, opting for a more ergonomic design with the use of durable plastic. While the previous version was straight, the new version slopes downward slightly with a 120 degree tilt outwards for a comfortable fit. The diaphragm in the ear piece uses an aerospace-grade metal composite material that\u2019s sandwiched between its PET layers for a more balanced output. For optimal mid-range and bass performance, the sound chambers now has a new spiral air flow design which seems to direct sound better into your ear. Designed for smart phone usage, the Mi Piston 3.0 also comes with a microphone module that has your typical volume up, down and selection button. Unlike the previous version where the mic is placed at the splitting end of the cord, it is now located on the right side cable, about 3 inches below the ear piece. The cable still uses kevlar fibre that\u2019s encased in a braided sleeve for better durability. From our long term use, the Piston 3.0 is more sleek in design and we find it to fit better in most ears. We know of some users complaining that the metal chambers of the current Piston 2.1 seem to hurt their ears during long usage, and it seems that the new ergonomic design has solved that. Noise isolation is a lot better and terms of quality, the mid-rangers are clearer while the bass is more warmer and full bodied. Overall, this is quite an improvement and the RM19 extra is definitely worth spending.If you\u2019re interested, head over to the Mi Store to place your orders.

{"text": "Ousting the 2 year old version, the new 2015 Chromecast is set to once again offer a better way to make your regular devices smarter; unspecific to it just being a TV anymore, with the Chromecast Audio. Coming in at a small form factor of 39.1grams the new streaming stick and its new music-inclined sibling now boast an improved WiFi frequency support,  to now be a circle and include an integrated HDMI cable.The pre-existing Chromecast used to look much like a stick with a HDMI head, opting for something a little more discrete and easier to plug in, Google has decided to switch to an integrated cable system to make the device easier plug in to hard-to-reach TV ports. The modern-looking Chromecast 2015 now adds support for a wider WiFi frequency; extending to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz with 802.11 ac bands. These bands have allowed Google to prove that the new device adapts to your WiFi surroundings in your home, giving you the best connection at any given time.Hardware aside, its app experience is now tweaked to give you a better overall time while using the device. Content is now shown on a home-screen but only caters to your personal app list, so if you don\u2019t have a certain app, content from it won\u2019t be shown. Though, through content discovery, it\u2019ll show you the available apps that have the content you\u2019ve choose to search for. Picking up (to) Full HD content on apps like Google Play, YouTube, Spotify and Netflix, users will surely have a lot of shows and movies to choose from.The updated Chromecast app wasn\u2019t that slow to begin with but thanks to a pre-fetching option called \u201cFast Play\u201d, app developers can allow their systems to decrease app load-times (80% faster in a test). Intrinsically, this pre-fetching extends further to utilise algorithms to pre-download content based on your behaviour \u2013 e.g. downloading a small bit of a new episode based on your current episode list. What about mobile gaming? Well, gaming is supported too, casting your screen onto your larger screen \u2013 now allowing multiplayer options that let users use their devices as controllers.Google also announced its audio only option with similar capabilities; the Chromecast Audio. As mentioned earlier, it\u2019ll make your regular devices a little smarter, allowing you to repurpose your older expensive Hi-Fi systems by making them a streaming machine \u2013 similarly to a bluetooth speaker BUT you won\u2019t be interrupted by phone calls anymore, since the device can run on its own without disturbing your listening.Owners can choose from an extensive list of apps like iHeart Radio, Pandora, Google Play Music (not available in Malaysia), Spotify and etc. Google aims to add to their Chromecast Audio app list throughout its lifetime. Some other perks when comparing it to a bluetooth speaker would be less battery drain, ability to use multiple cross-platform devices to control your \u201cnew\u201d smart-er speaker.Sharing is enabled through audio sharing on the app that gives users on the same network the capability to control music options on the Chromecast Audio. Best thing is, casting is done on the app you\u2019re playing your music from, so you won\u2019t need to learn an entirely new app just to play music. Later in the year an OTA update will even allow multi-room audio, syncing all your speakers to play from one source.Both devices are readily available in 17 countries (Malaysia left-out) but only cost $35 each (RM 156) and come in 3 colour options \u2013 Lemonade, Coral and Black.

It seems that it could be that the portability of their smartphones are driving them away from tablets and computers.Buying habits are now also being dictated through smartphones, although the numbers aren\u2019t too high at 20%. Supplementing this data are more percentages that corroborate that e-commerce is still quite stagnant in the country.51% of Malaysians prefer to do their groundwork on their purchases online but purchasing the actual item offline. The internet is helping them find out what they need and compare on the internet but knowing Asians, they still want to take a proper look at the thing they\u2019re putting their money towards. Another interesting trend is that 48% of our citizens find out about products through online resources, first. E-commerce as an industry is still finding it hard to tackle the local consumer, but they\u2019ll be happy to know that 30% of Malaysians are shopping online through other mediums (PCs, tablets, etc).Coming to a close, it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of smartphone users come from Gen Y or younger (under 25; 93%) but these numbers are increasing in all age ranges.

{"text": "There\u2019s a saying that good things come in pairs. And that appears to be the formula for new flagships like the Galaxy Note5/S6 edge+ and the more recent iPhone 6s/6s Plus. The Nexus project has always been a showcase of what Google can do if they have full control on both hardware and software. In its 7th Nexus smart phone generation along with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, they had introduced not one but 2 Nexus smart phones that cater towards different users. With very little introduction required, the Nexus 5X is their new compact \u201cflagship\u201d while the Nexus 6P is their cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me with a 5.7\u2033 phablet form factor and top spec underpinnings. With LG being called up for another Nexus duty, the Nexus 5X is an upgrade over its previous Nexus 5 that\u2019s encased in a premium injected molded polycarbonate body. The screen gets a slightly larger 5.2\u2033 size but it still does a modest Full HD resolution. In terms of power, it manages to pull through with a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor that\u2019s also powering the LG G4. It only gets 2GB RAM with an option of either 16GB or 32GB storage. Looking at the rear, the Nexus 5X gets a main 12.3MP camera which claims to outdo its better specced rivals. While there are cameras out there with higher pixel count, the 12.3MP shooter from Sony boasts a larger 1.55 \u03bcm pixel size, which is pretty much the same formula as HTC\u2019s Ultrapixel shooter. The main camera has a f/2.0 aperture lens, dual flash light and an IR laser AF for quicker focus. For the front, it gets a rather standard 5MP f/2.0 camera with 1.4 \u03bcm pixel size. Audio is pushed from a single speaker that\u2019s firing from the front. Connectivity wise, it supports a wide range of networks covering Cat 6 4G LTE in TDD and FDD spectrums. It also has WiFi 802.11ac in 2\u00d72 MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC support as standard. For better security, the rear mounted fingerprint scanner that\u2019s called the Nexus Imprint lets you unlock by a mere touch. It recognises in under 600 ms and it learns to get better each time it is being put to use. Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh battery that\u2019s rated for all day use and it charges up using USB Type C that supports Quick Charge. The Nexus 5X is available for pre-orders at selected markets with the 16GB version priced from US$379 (about RM1,690).As seen in earlier leaks, this is the first Nexus phone produced by Huawei. Apart from being a new appointed Nexus maker, it is also the first all metal Nexus smart phone and it boasts a rather slender 7.3mm thickness. With Huawei being reluctant of pushing a Quad HD smart phones, the Nexus 6P breaks that tradition with a 5.7\u2033 Quad HD display that pushes a stunning 518ppi. To protect the display from harm, it gets toughen with Gorilla Glass 4 and there\u2019s an added oleophobic coating for smudge resistance. The design looks like an odd mix between a Huawei P8 and an honor 7 especially with that visible camera bump. For audio playback, it does get a pair of front firing speakers and recording is assisted by 3 microphones that double up for noise cancellation. Under the hood, the Nexus 6P runs on a Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. You get more storage options ranging from 32GB, 64GB and 128GB which are also non-expandable.The list of connectivity support, Nexus Imprint and USB Type C are similar as the Nexus 5X but the same 12.3MP camera gets an extra trick of having to support a higher Slow Motion recording of 240FPS. Taking selfies should be better as well as the 6P gets a higher 8MP f/2.4 shooter. In terms of battery, it gets a phablet category 3,450mAh capacity unit which is fitting for the specs it carries. The Nexus 6P is priced from US$499 which is roughly RM2,225 in our current rates.  Both models are quite pricey when compared to mainstream Android smart phones but for the Android purist that want to get the very latest Android might appreciate one of these Marshmallow preloaded smart phones.

With about 2 days to go, the purported presentation slides for the Nexus 6P have surfaced online, revealing almost everything you need to know about the latest phablet. Firstly, the new Nexus 6P is the first Nexus flagship to feature an all metal build. Instead of a 6 incher (5.96\u2033) like the current Motorola based Nexus 6, the new 6P that\u2019s made by Huawei is going for a slightly smaller 5.7\u2033 display. It pushes a Quad HD resolution that\u2019s protected by Gorilla Glass 4. Accompanying the display is a pair of front ported speakers similar to its predecessor. Under the metal body, the Nexus 6P runs on Qualcomm\u2019s Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor that\u2019s found on most flagships today. There\u2019s no mention of RAM but it comes with a variety of storage sizes \u2013 32GB, 64GB and 128GB. As usual, there\u2019s no expandable storage via microSD.For the first time on a Nexus, it will get USB Type-C which supports both faster data transfer and Quick Charge. At the back, there\u2019s also a fingerprint scanner, that lets you unlock or skip passwords at a single touch.For imaging, the deck didn\u2019t reveal exact pixel count numbers but its \u201cNexus Camera\u201d is said to have been improved for better low light shots. Paired with its Google camera app, it promises quicker capture while keeping your subject in focus. .: According to  which has gotten a couple of more slides, the camera is confirmed to be a 12.3MP f/2.0 unit that comes with a larger 1.55 \u03bcM pixel size which allows more light. Meanwhile at the front, it is expected to carry a 8MP camera that has a standard 1.4 \u03bcM pixel size. With a 3,450mAh capacity battery, the Nexus 6P weighs 178 grams. That\u2019s quite remarkable as it is 230mAh more than the current Nexus 6 but it is still lighter by 6 grams. The biggest change in terms of experience is definitely Android M as it comes with a couple of tweaks on app management, power efficiency and native support for more features including a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C. : The Nexus 6P  at US$499.99 (about RM2,215) for the 32GB storage option.It will be available in 4 colours \u2013 Aluminium, Graphite, Frost and Gold, with the last colour surprisingly exclusive initially for Japan.

Moving away from the typical square and toyish design, the new Pebble looks like a traditional watch with a variety of colours and bands to match.

When compared to other smart watches, you\u2019ll notice a much thicker bezel but Pebble somewhat has managed to mask it with a variety of patterns from circular lines to numeric markers for the hour and minutes. The biggest sacrifice of going round and thin would be its battery life. Instead of the usual 7 to 10 days of use, the Pebble Time Round is rated to last just up to 2 days on a single charge. According to Pebble this is a worthy trade off for style and the new Time Round also supports quick charge, giving 24 hours of use with a quick 15 minutes charge. So a full charge for 2 days use in theory can be done in just 30 minutes, which is heaps faster than the Apple Watch. Charging is still done with its magnetic USB charger that snaps onto the back of the watch. Another trade off for the Pebble Time Round is it isn\u2019t as water resistant as before. On the previous Pebbles including the Time Steel, it can be submerged under 30 metres of water with its 5 ATM rating. The Pebble Time Round however is only splash resistant even with its IPX7 rating. The product page has explicitly mentioned: \u201cPebble Time Round is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water\u2013like unforeseeable rain\u2013won\u2019t ruin your device, but submerging the watch is not recommended.\u201dNo doubt the Pebble Time is more basic in \u201csmart features\u201d as compared to the Moto 360, Samsung Gear S2, Huawei Watch and LG Urbane. For Pebble, it isn\u2019t about cramming the most tech but the main focus is on building a functional watch that tells the time 24/7 without sleep with the capabilities of notifications and apps. It is a pretty looking thing but we expected them to at least maintain the impressive 7 days of battery life. The good thing about Pebble is that it supports both Android and iOS devices, giving it a wider compatibility than other smart watches out there. If you\u2019re interested, it is available for  at US$249.99 (RM1,095) with shipping to start sometime in November. Want something simpler? The original Pebble Classic is  for US$99 (RM438).

Most mainstream players have announced their flagships for the 2nd half of this year, which includes the Galaxy Note5, Sony Xperia Z5 and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. If you are expecting HTC to come out with a new flagship to close the gap, you could be in for a disappointment. The new HTC Aero was initially  to run on MediaTek\u2019s top of the line Helio X20 processor that comes with 10 cores.

Instead, it gets a more mainstream 5\u2033 Full HD display, a Snapdragon 617 processor that\u2019s mated with just 2GB of RAM and has 16GB of storage on board. For imaging, it has a 13MP main camera with OIS while the front retains HTC\u2019s 4MP Ultra-pixel camera.

{"text": "Today Meizu has announced the PRO 5, a new premium flagship smart phone which has the means to take on the best Android smart phones available today. With Samsung  with its own in house developed components, you won\u2019t be surprised to see Meizu putting the best possible specs to raise the bar higher.At 5.7 inch, it has the same display size as the Galaxy Note5 and home ground rival Mi Note. Instead of having a Quad HD display, Meizu is settling for a more traditional Full HD AMOLED display that comes encased under a 2.5D glass. Design wise, it retains the same unibody metal design as the past flagships like the  and the . At the front, it has a home button that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. The new generation fingerprint scanner is said to be quicker with 0.5 second response time when touched in any direction. The hardware underneath is where it gets a little interesting. It runs on the same Exynos 7420 processor as the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5 that\u2019s mated to either 3GB or 4GB of DDR4 RAM. On top of that, it also utilises Samsung\u2019s  (UFS 2.0) which is faster and more efficient compared to typical eMMC 5.0 storage. With its own optimisation, the Meizu PRO 5 smashes the Galaxy S6 in Antutu benchmarks scoring over 77,000 points. There are 2 variants available, with the 3GB RAM paired with 32GB of storage, while the higher 4GB RAM variant gets 64GB of storage. In the imaging department, the back gets Sony\u2019s new IMX230 21MP camera with Phase Detection AF, Laser Auto Focus assistance and dual-LED flash. Meanwhile the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter that comes with its own beautification features. For sound, the PRO 5 boasts Hi-Fi quality audio with its additional ES9018K2M DAC and OPA1612 OP Amp. Keeping the lights on, the Meizu PRO 5 is juiced up by a 3,050mAh capacity battery which comes with its mCharge 2.0 feature. With a faster 24W fast charger, it can charge up from 0-65% in just 30 minutes. That\u2019s faster than Samsung but it is still a notch below OPPO\u2019s VOOC Flash Charger that does 0-75% in the same duration. Meizu has also ditched the old school microUSB port for a reversible USB Type C that\u2019s currently used on the latest MacBook, OnePlus 2, Nokia N1 and the recently announced Xiaomi Mi 4c.   In terms of connectivity, it supports dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and the 2nd slot accepts microSD with expandable storage up to 128GB extra. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.1 but with a heavily skinned FlymeOS 5.0 running on top. The Meizu PRO 5 is priced at 2,799CNY (about RM1,908) for the 32GB version while its bigger 64GB model is priced at 3,099CNY (about RM2,112). That\u2019s quite a huge step up from its previous flagships, encroaching the price range of its mainstream rivals.

Considering the brand has been hit hard even in Korea, it\u2019s assumed that adding devices to their existing inventory could boost sales; especially since they have yet to refresh the LG G Pro 2 that was released early last year.Touted as the aforementioned phablet\u2019s successor, the LG V10 is seen to be the maker\u2019s answer to their domestic rivals, Samsung \u2013 a move that saw the LG G Pro 2 rival the then Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Much alike their rivals with their styluses, LG seeks to add their own twist to the mobile device world (while still copying some cues from who else, ) by adding this \u201cticker display\u201d.A similar rendition of , that allows users to have a continuous\u00a0info-stream on the smaller display, while the device\u2019s main display is off. But for a better viewing experience, the LG V10\u2019s ticker\u00a0display is horizontal, so no need to turn your head or the device in horizontal orientation to view notifications \u2013 assuming that it offers the same features as the Note Edge.When looks are considered, it pretty much takes a lot after the , more so due to the lower front being empty, as the button placements are all on the back. A backing which seems to have a textured finish, based on photos.That aside, it\u2019ll sport a 5.7-inch main display that pushes QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution, while the secondary smaller notification-like display has no mention of its pixels. In terms of it\u2019s processor, the V10 is rumoured to carry the tried and true 6 cored Snapdragon 808 processor; aimed to play it safe and forgo\u00a0issues with the Qualcomm 810\u2019s overheating. It will have 3GB of RAM and a standard 64GB of internal memory; no mention of a microSD slot, unfortunately.Camera optics however stand at a supposed 16-megapixels for the rear camera, together with laser auto-focus and dual-LED flash but the front is where it takes an expected turn. From the image provided, it looks like LG\u2019s V10 will have some form of dual-front facing cameras \u2013 then again these are leaks so lets not dwell much further. It could simply just be an LED flash but there is information stating that the front camera will be a 5-megapixel sensor.Rounding off, the home button might have been redesigned to house a finger-print sensor but we\u2019re just speculating off  For now that\u2019s pretty much all there is about this new LG device but with October the 1 not long away, the New York announcement should answer all our questions about this phablet.[  ]", "id": "531"},

With people willing to do almost anything to get the latest Apple product, a special kind of bank is offering an attractive way of owning iPhone 6s. Nope, you won\u2019t even need to lose any of your  to get it and it is easier than you think. In a populous country with over a billion people, China surprisingly is in dire need to fill up 18 sperm banks around the country. Struggling to attract new donors, they have started a campaign that offers an easier way of obtaining an iPhone 6s. All they need to do is to make a donation at a sperm bank. The Hubei Human Sperm Bank had sent out a message over WeChat that links to an article entitled \u201cNew ways to get an iPhone 6s\u201d. Inside it explains that the bank is seeking donors aged 22 to 45, with each to receive 5,000 CNY (about RM3,321) in subsidies. This in return would make them a step closer of buying an iPhone 6s that\u2019s priced at 5,288 CNY (about RM3,512). So far there\u2019s no word of its reception but the intimate deal has managed to get quite a lot of attention recording over 400,000 reads. You must be wondering why sperm donation is a concern in China considering they have strict population control. According to a research by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, the sperm fertility of Chinese males has been dropping by 1% each year since the 80s. With the mad desire for the latest iPhone, this is probably the safest and less excruciating route for those without cash to spare. [ ,  ]", "id": "548"},

Apple\u2019s main showcase to its new gaming element will be Disney Infinity 3.0, Guitar Hero Live and Rayman Adventures\u2019, surely pleasing a wide range of gamers out there.A further extension of apps bring about a demonstration of online shopping directly on Apple TV, thanks to companies like Gilt \u2013 giving Apple an edge when compared to other set-top boxes out there. Obviously they won\u2019t be leaving out the main purpose of the device, providing TV enthusiasts the viewing tools to get push notifications for game-time moments in live sports games.Potentially a great living room companion, the Apple TV starts shipping towards the end of October in 80 countries and will go for $149 / RM 641 (32GB) and $199 / RM 856 (64GB).

{"text": "Starting yesterday, an Australian by the name Lindsay Handmer has been camping outside Sydney\u2019s main CBD Apple store to be one of the first worldwide to purchase the latest iPhone. A brave venture, considering that when the device will go on sale is still unknown; even crazier is the fact that Apple\u2019s keynote only happens tomorrow.Pitching himself outside the extremely well-lit store located on George Street (the same store we visited to check out the ), has so far spent a day on his fold-able chair and tent\u00a0combo. His intentions are based on past instances of the Oceanic country being one of the first to have the latest Apple products in store.Handmer has taken this brief moment of fame to (shamelessly) plug his self-created online secondhand technology marketplace, mysparetech.com, since seeing that other individuals have done it prior during their own line-up adventures. Apple\u2019s iPhones tend to hit shelves around the 18 of September, if they\u2019re sticking to their existing habits, Handmer will be out in the 12-17 degree Celsius weather for quite some time.Apart of his marketing stunt, the Australian won\u2019t be purchasing the device for himself, instead he intends to auction the device(s) off for a charitable cause \u2013 , a startup that helps the homeless. He\u2019s said that so far \u201cit\u2019s an up and down process\u201d when asked about his experience so far going 24 hours in to the camp-out and had times where he questioned his decision to do so.The legality of it all is kind of up in the air, at least as far as Handmer is concerned, as the police officers he momentarily crossed paths with only pulled up to head into the nearby McDonald\u2019s \u2013 at least for now. When more people join in the craze, he plans on keeping the atmosphere high by getting some party lights and music.It\u2019ll be interesting to see how long he lasts out there but he\u2019s fortunate enough to have a 24/7 McDonald\u2019s and some gyms around the vicinity if he needs to get some food and freshen-up. Best of all, he\u2019ll have some company during the weekend, when his fiance joins in.These occurrences are never bad for Apple but the employees at the Sydney store have some raised eyebrows at how the first potential person to purchase the latest iPhone uses a Dell laptop, together with a HTC phone. When asked about this, Handmer merely quipped that \u201cApple makes great products, but I guess I like the more technical stuff. Android, for those type of things.\u201d and \u201cI just tend to opt for the more affordable side of stuff.\u201dIf you\u2019re interested to prepare yourself for a similar adventure, you can follow his journey on .Share with us your best experiences of lining up to purchase something, we\u2019d surely like to hear about it in the comments below.[  ]", "id": "571"},

Apple has even stepped up the personalisation of their two (out of three) watch models.App developers are now tooled to improve their apps thanks to watchOS 2, letting them play around with the watch\u2019s hardware, opening doors to apps like iTranslate; for giving you voice translations on the fly, or the GoPro app, that lets you use your watch display as a viewfinder.Innovating in other fields like those involved in medicine, AirStip has already existed on other iDevices (iPhone and iPad) but with an upgrade to watchOS 2, the app now gives medical practitioners and the hospital team easier accessibility to patient records and their health readings.Daily rounds are displayed on the app, connecting the team within a network that lets them communication and share patient data on a more productive level. Time travel is now enabled and turning the digital crown lets you go through your daily rounds schedule to see upcoming patient visits and other appointments. Developers are also bringing another health monitoring app to the table, with Sense 4 Baby opening the same doors but for mothers and doctors that want to monitor a baby\u2019s health while still in a womb. Sensors placed on the mother\u2019s belly allows this and doctors can get an NST reading straight after the mother does a test at home \u2013 making the whole affair a more practical one.To the aesthetic side of things, Apple now adds to its collaboration list with Hermes joining forces to provide luxury watch bands and its own distinctive watch face with Hermes iconography. Hand-stitched leather in 3 options the Double Tour ($1,250/RM5,465), Single Tour ($1,100/RM4,852), and Cuff ($1,500/RM6,557) seems to be Apple\u2019s venture into the more fashionable side of smart wearables.The French artisans made the first option to wrap twice around your wrist, coupling feminine elegance with security of mind.

However, the single only comes in the Fauve and Noir, with an additional Capucine band for the 38mm.Hermes caps it off with the Cuff leather option, said to be created to stay in contact with the wrist better for a more accurate heart rate monitoring. It is\u00a0only available in the 42mm stainless steel case in a Fauve colourway.Subsequently, Apple has also been busy updating their own designs, as two new finishes are now added to the line-up \u2013 Gold and Rose gold (38mm and 42mm) are now available in iodised aluminium. Two great colours that maintain the pricing of the original sports line up ($ 349/RM1,526 for 38mm, $ 399/RM1,736 for 42mm).

The Galaxy S6 edge has an impressive camera and the new Note5 shouldn\u2019t be far off. Following closely is the LG G4 which boast a similar 16MP sensor, faster f/1.8 lens and it comes assisted with Laser AF. In terms of pixel count, the Sony Xperia M5, honor 7 and HTC One E9+ leads on paper with its 20MP+ sensor. Like everything we\u2019ve seen in the past, a higher pixel count doesn\u2019t necessary represent higher quality. The Xperia M5 and honor 7 looks promising as it uses Sony\u2019s latest IMX230 sensor that has Phase Detection AF for faster focus. While we are at it, we\u2019ve also thrown in the Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the OnePlus 2 that comes with a 13MP camera with OIS. Of course, we can\u2019t forget the iPhone 6.

{"text": "The  has revolutionised the way we consume content on a portable device. It started the whole tablet mania and it became the world\u2019s  consumer product in history. For those needing to do some serious work on the go, the iPad still works but it isn\u2019t as cut out as a real workhorse like the MacBook Air. With , the next big wave seems to be focused on convergence devices that blurs the line between tablet and PC like the . And that\u2019s where Apple is heading with its new iPad Pro that was announced today at San Francisco. Designed as the ultimate media consumption and productivity tool, the iPad Pro is their largest tablet yet with a huge 12.9\u2033 Retina Display that does 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution. This gives 78% more display area than its current iPad Air 2 and it pushes the same pixel density of 264 pixels per inch. It is 6.9mm thick, the same thickness as the  but thicker than the iPad Air at 6.1mm. Being a bigger device, it is heavier as well at 713 grams for WiFi and 723 grams for the Cellular version. As comparison, the original iPad weighs in at 680 grams for WiFi and it goes as much as 730 grams for the 3G + WiFi model. Like the rest of the iPad range, the exterior design is typical iPad and it gets a TouchID enabled home button along with Silver, Gold and Space Grey colour options.What makes this a productivity beast is on the inside. With a newer iOS 9 out of the box, you get more multi-tasking features which include split screen along with more shortcuts to get things done quicker. The A9X 64-bit chip on-board is their most powerful mobile processor yet with almost twice the power of the A8X chip found on the iPad Air 2. Setting the iPad Pro apart from the mainstream iPad is its new Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessory. Now this is starting to look like a Surface fighting device. The Smart Keyboard is sold separately as a US$169 option (about RM730) and doubles up as a smart cover with a keyboard built-in. It consists of 64 seamless keys that\u2019s spill resistant. The fabric microfiber of the cover is just 3.2mm thin while the keys pops up slightly at 4mm with its spring-like tension feedback. Attaching the Smart Keyboard onto the iPad is seamless which lets you snap on and use immediately without the need of wireless pairing. Unlike the Surface which has ridges on the sides, the iPad Pro connectors are flush with its 3 smart connector pins. Steve Jobs used to poked fun at the stylus when the iPhone was introduced. For its new productivity product, they have finally introduced one as the Apple Pencil. This adds another freehand interaction which gives you the familiarity of a pencil. Boasting a 240 times per second response time, drawing claims to be more real time with no noticeable lags and it recognises pressure from a gentle touch to thicker stroke lines. It even supports shading when drawn sideways, as if you\u2019re drawing with a charcoal pencil. During the keynote, they have invited Microsoft and Adobe on stage to demonstrate the Pencil\u2019s editing capability for both MS Office and Photoshop. The Apple Pencil lasts 12 hours on a single charge which is juiced up with its lightning connector hidden underneath its silicon cap at the end. To charge it, you\u2019ll need to plug it into the iPad Pro, which would probably look awkward if you\u2019re carrying it while on the go. Thankfully it manages to rejuice an impressive 30 minutes of battery life from a mere 15 second charge. The Apple Pencil is sold separately at US$99 which is about RM427. One minor gripe is there\u2019s no place for you to keep the Pencil on the iPad Pro and it doesn\u2019t even come with a clip for you to hook it onto the case or a folder. Perhaps that might come as another optional accessory.So for the full productivity suite, the Smart Keyboard and  pencil will set you back close to RM1,200. Quite a substantial amount to pay compared to the \u2018s Type Cover Keyboard and Pen costing RM479 and RM189 respectively. For video and music playback, the iPad Pro boasts 4 speakers with a pair of stereo speakers mounted on the top and bottom which rotates according to the orientation you\u2019re in. For imaging, it gets the same 8MP f/2.4 main camera and a front facing 1.2MP HD Facetime unit as the iPad Air 2. Even with its bigger display and power processor, the iPad Pro still pushes its same 10 hour battery life on a single charge. At this point, you probably know that the iPad Pro will not come cheap. This is going to be a very niche device like the 12.2\u2033 Samsung Galaxy NotePro 12.2 and its higher end model is actually pricier than a full blown MacBook Air 11\u2033 with 128GB at US$899 (RM3,391 Malaysian RRP). With the thinner MacBook around, the iPad Pro potentially could replace the MacBook Air completely. After all, you could run all your regular office and designing chores with iOS versions of MS Office and Photoshop. The iPad Pro starts from US$799 (about RM3,462) for the 32GB WiFi model, while the larger 128GB unit is sold at US$949 (about RM4,112). For the all round connectivity with 4G LTE support, the 128GB WiFi + Cellular version is priced at US$1,079 (about RM4,700).

Suddenly buying iPhones are looking like an investment if you bought one early. Apart from having the 128GB version discontinued, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus no longer has the Gold colour option.

{"text": "Apple has just announced its new  and the larger  phablet, and like every iPhone \u201cS\u201d model, it is an update over its previous model without having an all new design. This time around, it is more than just incremental performance upgrades. The new iPhone 6s uses tougher materials to silence its  critics and it incorporates its Force Touch and Taptic engine features from the . There\u2019s also a new colour for the iPhone that\u2019s called Rose Gold.This is possibly the biggest iPhone incremental \u201cmodel update\u201d since the .  Like the iPhone 6/6 Plus duo, the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus retains the same 4.7\u2033 and 5.5\u2033 Retina Display option. No changes in display resolution but underneath its metal unibody shell is an upgraded 64-bit A9 chip that promises up to 70% better performance over its previous A8 processor. The M9 motion co-processor that keeps track of your activities is now integrated onto the A9 chip, which helps to improve performance and battery life. Now it gets the additional ability to track your running as well as your walking pace in addition to steps, distance and elevation. While the overall design looks the same as the previous model, the iPhone 6s/6s Plus is actually slightly bulkier and heavier than its predecessor. This is probably due to its new use of material that comprises of 7000 series Aluminium, the strongest they\u2019ve ever fitted on an iPhone and special dual ion\u2011exchange process glass which they claim to be the strongest in the smart phone industry. As a result, it adds 0.1-0.2mm to its thickness, width and length. The weight should be noticeably heavier with 14 grams extra on the iPhone 6s (6s: 143g, 6: 129g) and 20 grams more on the iPhone 6s Plus (6s Plus: 192g, 6 Plus: 172g). In terms of colours, Apple is still retaining the same Silver, Space Grey and Gold but it now gets a Rose Gold colour option which is a more feminine with a pink hue. Nothing has changed in terms of storage as Apple continues the same 16GB, 64GB and 128GB capacity options. Personally we wished Apple had killed the 16GB option and set 32GB as the bare minimum for a flagship. After toying around with Force Touch trackpads and watches, the pressure sensitive tech has finally made its way onto the iPhone as 3D Touch. This gives the multi-touch display another form of interaction as it is able to differentiate soft to hard presses. With a gentle touch, you can now preview links while hard presses bring up additional shortcuts and menus on iOS 9. From the home screen, you can jump straight into selfie or slow-mo videos by hard pressing on the camera icon. Alternatively you can jump straight to Inbox or New Message when you do the same on the Mail icon. In short, this is like having a right click function on a computer. Developers can also take advantage of 3D Touch as well with games making use of the finger pressure for additional controls. The iPhone 6s/6s Plus also gets a Taptic engine which gives a more immersive feedback as you force touch into the display. Like the Apple Watch, this gives you a sensation of a glass being tapped or pressing through the glass that feels more realistic than the conventional buzzing vibration. Speaking of touch, the Touch ID fingerprint scanner has been improved with its 2nd generation unit, promising quicker response time than before.As the competition  its camera capabilities, Apple has finally upgraded its iSight camera in pixel count from 8MP to 12MP with f/2.2 aperture. This is the first major camera upgrade since the iPhone 4S. It still gets dual-tone LED flash for more natural lit pictures while the 6s Plus has the additional feature of Optical Image Stabilisation. Finally 4K Video recording is supported and you can make ultra high resolution movies on the fly with its built-in editing tools.For Selfies, the front FaceTime HD camera has been upgraded from 1.2MP to 5MP f/2.4. To illuminate your face in the low light conditions, the new iPhones get Retina Flash, which basically increases the front display brightness by 3X as a light source.  Another neat feature is Live Photos where it starts shooting before the point of shooting a picture until after a few seconds after that. This gives you a short clip which actually consists of multiple shots and it is done automatically on every single photo that you take, which is kind of similar to HTC\u2019s Zoe. To preview the Live Photo, just simply press harder onto a picture in the gallery for a quick playback.

As usual Malaysia won\u2019t be among the early batch of countries but if you want, you can try your luck in , ,  and .

While the upgrades from KitKat from Jelly Bean seems to be fast, the fact remains that most devices are still being left behind without much software updates.

To refresh your memory, the Zerolution programme is a new way of owning a new smart phone and it comes with added device protection in a form of an insurance as well as the option to swap to a new phone after 12 months. There\u2019s no hefty upfront payments and you can leave at any time without any penalty charges as long as you settle the remainder of your monthly installments in full.The Galaxy Note5 is offered at RM138/month while the Galaxy S6 edge+ can be yours at RM156/month. These installment figures are inclusive of its RM30/month early upgrade fee, which allows you to swap to a new device after 12 months and RM15/month for extra device protection which covers theft and all sorts of damages to your device. Note that for the early device upgrade to happen, you would need to ensure that your device is in pristine condition, hence they have recommended the optional device protection offer. If the device is returned in unacceptable conditions, a RM300 fee might apply when you make a swap.Even if you don\u2019t plan to upgrade or need the extra device protection, the Galaxy Note5 effectively costs RM93/month, which in 24 months cost a total of RM2,232. That\u2019s RM467 cheaper than the full retail price of RM2,699. The Galaxy S6 edge+ would effectively cost RM2,664 in the same calculation, which is a RM435 savings from its RM3,099 outright price.Of course, the catch is that you\u2019ll need to subscribe to their  which starts from RM98/month. That comes with unlimited calls, SMS and 1GB of data. For every additional 2GB of data, it will cost you RM30/month extra.

In terms of design, the overall shape hasn\u2019t change since the early Z series with its omni-balance approach of having a flat slab with subtle rounded corners. Gone is the iconic chrome power button and it is replaced by a wider flat looking one which potentially could double up as a fingerprint scanner. The frame has a poly-carbonate looking material with matte finish, while the premium version seems to have a glossy look to it.

The aluminium frame now gets a carved Xperia on the sides and the iconic power button has been replaced with an integrated fingerprint scanner. In the past Xperia Z series, the glass back is elegant to look at but it is also a huge fingerprint magnet. This time, Sony has opt for a frosted glass back, which aims to put an end to smudgy looking phones. Surprisingly the dimensions of the Xperia Z5 is identical with the Xperia Z3 at 7.3mm thick and it weighs slightly heavier at 154g (Xperia Z3: 152g). This makes the Xperia Z3+ the thinnest and lightest Xperia Z flagship at just 6.9mm and 144g respectively.

On-board storage still stays at 32GB with expandable storage made possible with microSD up to 200GB. Like the , the new 23MP sensor takes centre stage at the back, promising ultra-quick captures with its 0.03 second focus time.For selfies, it gets the same 5MP shooter as the Xperia Z3+ along with a wide angle 25mm lens. The battery on the other hand is slightly smaller than the Xperia Z3+ at 2,900mAh but Sony still reckons it maintains the same up to 2 days of battery life on a single charge. In terms of colours, the Xperia Z5 comes in Graphite Black, Gold, White and Green. It is also available in either Single and Dual-SIM variants, supporting 4G LTE. Offering a flagship experience without the bulk, the Xperia Z5 Compact comes with a smaller 4.6\u2033 display that does HD 720p (1280\u00d7720) resolution. It shares the same Snapdragon 810 processor as the bigger Z5 brother but it comes mated with just 2GB of RAM. Storage remains unchanged at 32GB and it also gets the same 23MP main and 5MP front cameras. Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh capacity battery that\u2019s rated to last up to 2 days. Being a more youthful device, the Z5 Compact comes in Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral colours. Overall, it is slightly thicker at 8.9mm but it weighs a much lighter 138 grams.

{"text": "Yesterday we addressed the big ruckus that\u2019s been going around regarding the \u2018s S Pen \u201cdesign flaw\u201d \u2013 we use that phrase\u00a0loosely, as the Korean manufacturers realised the problem but it was probably too late to rectify the problem, due to it being too late in the process. So does printing a disclaimer save them from the backlash?As far as we\u2019re concerned, when you fork out RM 2,699 for a phablet, you\u2019re expecting something that has stood up to vigorous testing. How far along were they before they finally realised? Was putting up that 25 page in the user manual adequate? What actually causes the S Pen functionality to go bust? We aren\u2019t entirely sure about the first two questions but we\u2019ll help answer the third in this article.Blessed to have the guys from  and\u00a0 who\u2019ve dived into this whole mess by showing what it looks like on the inside of the Note5 when the S Pen inserted the wrong way. Looking closer at the photo, you\u2019ll see levers that jut out in the silo: one controls S Pen detection and functionality, while the other secures the stylus from falling out the silo.The former/lever 1 sits in between the middle and the end of the silo, under the primary logic board angled upwards on the right of the S Pen; without this lever, you\u2019ll lose two features \u2013 Screen-off memo and Air Command. However, lever 1 doesn\u2019t cause the S Pen to get stuck \u2013 that\u2019s caused by lever 2. Located a little further up the silo, towards the end is the lever that will be the doom of your stylus.An intricate writing tool of sorts, it\u2019s designed to have two small cutouts near the writing end that holds it in firmly when slotted correctly, writing tip first. A positive design but here\u2019s the deal \u2013 if it\u2019s placed backwards or click side first, you\u2019ll see it getting hitched after passing the second lever. Once you\u2019re in this deep, you\u2019re probably not getting it out, considering the lack of space following this mishap.If you\u2019re lucky enough to get the backward S Pen passed the second lever, you\u2019re gonna have to get past the first lever again. Removing the Samsung stylus after this could likely damage the other plastic lever that\u2019s mounted inside an internal part soldered to the main board. Thin in nature, this plastic lever gives you the S Pen detection capability, thus making you disable S Pen Detection to get the stylus to work (that is if you\u2019ve managed to get it out in the first place) \u2013 killing the two aforementioned features, delivering a bleak Note5 writing experience.Sympathising with current and future owners of the Galaxy Note5, all we can do is advise everyone to avoid this scenario (as unrealistic as it is) and don\u2019t try to replicate this problem at all, you\u2019ll regret even trying to do so. We\u2019ve yet to see if Samsung will buckle from the feedback, probably offering some sort of replacement program, or have a software alert when the silo detects backwards insertion.Still excited about the Samsung Galaxy Note5?

{"text": "Following its , the  is finally announced for the international market. Almost a year after the release of its  in Malaysia, the new successor steps up with a premium build and enhanced features to close the gap with its flagship rivals. For those who are unfamiliar, Honor is Huawei\u2019s sub-brand that\u2019s digitally driven through its Vmall online stores. In China, the honor 7 did tremendously well with 200,000 sold online in just 2 minutes. To recap, the honor 7 is slightly larger at 5.2 inches and the IPS-Neo display pushes a Full HD resolution of 1920\u00d71080. Under the hood is an updated 64-bit Octa-Core (4X 1.5GHz + 4X 2.2GHz) Kirin 935 processor that\u2019s mated with 3GB of RAM. For the international market, it gets 16GB of on-board storage which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB.The overall build of the honor 7 is pretty solid with its unibody metal back that comes with a slight curve for a more comfortable grip. On the right, it gets a power button in the middle and a volume rocker right next to it. On the left side, you\u2019ll find a Smart Key button which can be customised to your reference and a SIM tray slot that supports dual-SIMs. The main speaker and microphones are placed at the bottom alongside its microUSB port, while the top comes with the standard headphone jack and an infrared blaster.  For photography, the honor 7 gets a much larger 20MP IMX230 sensor from Sony and a f/2.0 aperture lens. The new sensor comes with Phase Detection Auto Focus which provides an ultra-quick focusing time of 0.1 seconds. While the camera lens has a protruding bump, it uses sapphire glass to protect it from scratches. In terms of features, it supports a wide range of filters, slow-mo, time lapse and even light painting, a key feature that was introduced with the  flagship.At the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter with soft flash. Over at the back, the honor 7 also gets a fingerprint scanner which unlocks instantly on a single touch. Like the Huawei P8, it also supports knuckle sense, allowing you to double tap using your knuckle to take a screenshot but at the same time, it still supports the standard double tap to wake while the screen is switched off. Keeping the lights on is an embedded 3,100mAh battery and it also support quick charge which does 0-50% in 30 minutes. Overall the honor 7 weighs 157 grams and has a thickness of 8.5mm. Out of the box, it runs on EMUI 3.1 that\u2019s based on Android 5.0 Lollipop. The honor 7 is expected to come to Malaysia officially in September.

{"text": "After 5 years running, Xiaomi has made its global announcement of  yesterday. With its humble beginnings back in 2010, the MIUI custom ROM has grown with over 150 Million users and is supported by a team of 750 people. While the interface looks the same as the current MIUI 6, the new version offers more customisation and it gets smarter with a several intelligent tweaks. Read on for the 10 new features after the break.Your smart phone is a personal device and MIUI has been known for its wide array of radical customisable themes. On MIUI 7, they are really pushing the themes up a notch with greater focus on design details. With Muse, a new theme creator, you can design new interfaces with animations including the lock screen like never before. And this is done without the complicated coding.Receiving phone calls can be made more interesting especially when it\u2019s from your loved ones. Instead of having a static photo, you can change this to a 5 second looping video. If you have tons of instant message groups and social media accounts, your phone would always be demanding for attention. While you can always turn on silent mode before sleeping, MIUI 7 is making the DND mode automated with the help of a Mi Band. The Mi Band as an activity tracker knows when you\u2019re asleep and will automatically turns on DND mode. Once you\u2019re awake, it is also smart enough to disable DND mode so that you start receiving alerts right away. Especially for the elderly, viewing normal text size can be a strain. While you can easily bump up the text size, the execution isn\u2019t always perfect with broken lines and ugly alignment. With MIUI 7, it now offers an even larger XXL size and it is done beautifully in any screen without breaking its original layout design. Data is core in every smart phone experience. Not everyone has a huge data plan and high-speed coverage could be limited especially in developing countries. To ensure an optimal internet experience, Xiaomi has incorporated Opera Max Data Saver which helps to compress data not only in browser but also in other internet connected apps. This helps to speed up loading and will also help to cut down consumption of your precious internet quotas. For those with kids, your smart phone is the best camera of capturing moments in any situation. If need to show photos of your baby, it can be a daunting task if your album is filled with random pictures. To make things easier, they now have a Baby Album which automatically creates a collection for your baby with the help of facial recognition. Similar to Huawei\u2019s Magazine cover feature, you can have a different lock screen wallpaper every single day. There\u2019s a selection of high quality images and this will be made available first in India before it is released for international markets.  Sometimes your kids might want to \u201csteal\u201d your phone for a short game or two. To keep your data private and phone settings intact from curious fingers, the Child Mode lets you pick which apps and features that are accessible to them.  Performance is always a concern of users and MIUI 7 has been tweaked to provide a faster experience. App start up times have been optimised by loading both data and animations in parallel and Xiaomi claims a 30% improvement in app response. According to Xiaomi, as much as 48% of battery life are consumed by background processes such as GPS, mobile data and WiFi. To squeeze more life from each charge, they have optimised its background usage as well as regulating app sync times to minimise consumption. As a result, this would give 10% better battery life which is equivalent of up to 3 hours extra each day. If you can\u2019t wait to give it a go, MIUI 7 will be available as a beta release beginning 24th August on the .

The Phi aim is to simplify drone flying and make it easy for the average consumer to use with minimal training required. Extending up to 26 feet and having the ability to attach a GoPro to the kite-drone, one can only imagine the possibilities of aerial photography.Being funded through the crowd-funding platform, Indiegogo, the Phi (drone only, no GoPro) is available for pre-order for $249 USD / RM 1027 (now $289 USD / RM 1191) and will ship sometime in Q1 2016. Not a stranger to the drone world, Fotokite previously developed and launched the Fotokite Pro, that has made itself a regular in news organisations like the BBC.Handing tools to potential citizen journalists around the world, the Fotokite Phi is set to enable access to harmful protests zones or provide a less worrisome experience in a large open spaced area. Flight is propelled by 4 low-torqued plastic blades shielded by guards to decrease chances of injury, if one were to come in contact with the flying robot.The aforementioned inspiration behind the creation of the Fotokite was Lupashin\u2019s observations during protests stemming, due to the suspicious federal election that took place in Russia back in 2011. Thankfully, some of these occurrences were captured by drone photographers who were in the area, which gave us a good look at how the Russian people were reacting. Hence, it proved that drone journalism would be pivotal but the only obstacle would be the necessary knowledge to fly a drone in crowded areas \u2013 that\u2019s where the innovative leash system would come in.Making use of the same technology in retractable dog leashes, Lupashin excluding the need of a well-versed drone pilot. Tethered in such a manner whereby the leash line sits just below the provided GoPro slot, it\u2019ll ensure that the lens always stays pointed towards the individual manning the drone.Weighing only 12 ounces / 341 grams (including the battery and camera) the Fotokite Phi can fold itself to maximise space and is kept away in its packing tube. Twist gestures command the device to start-up and turning min-flight is manipulated by a button click and similar flick of the wrist, while the leash can be slacked to provide a wider viewing area for stills and video.If you\u2019re in the market for something a little higher end, you can look at the Fotokite Pro \u2013 mainly the same as its more affordable sibling (15 minutes fly-time) except for the tether doubling as a power cable and a downlink transfer for uncompressed HD video, providing longer recording and flight-times.

{"text": "Buying a smart phone on contract sometimes can be like a jail sentence. Not only you\u2019re tied for 24 months but you would also need to fork out a huge sum of money upfront, which sometimes cost more in total than the actual phone itself. While there are some telcos offering zero waiver for upfront payments, you\u2019re essentially still tied down to the same phone until your 24 months duration is up. Maxis wants to change the way you buy your smart phones by introducing the Zerolution program. It promises absolutely no payment upfront, no contracts and no interest fee over your monthly payments. Best of all, this isn\u2019t an Easy Payment Plan that requires a credit card. Everything you hate about a phone contract be gone. Sounds too good to be true? Read on to find out. To get a phone through Zerolution, you\u2019ll need to pick a new  that starts from RM98/month and then pick the phone you want. By default, the monthly payment is calculated over a 24 months period and if you decide to leave, you\u2019ll just need to pay the balance without any penalty charges.For those that want to own the latest phones every year, there\u2019s an early upgrade option at RM30/month. So after 12 months, you can surrender your current device and switch to a newer phone without any penalty or upgrade cost. Just pick a new phone and pay the new monthly payment. In order to upgrade, the device must be in good working order which means no cracked screen or serious dents on the device. If the device is not in good order, a RM300 fee will apply. For better peace of mind, they are offering a device protection at RM15/month that\u2019s comes with 48 hours replacement. For now the Zerolution program covers 4 devices \u2013 the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, HTC One M9+ and the Samsung Galaxy A7. All new flagship devices will be available on Zerolution moving forward and gradually its existing line up including the iPhone 6 will be offered later. Considering the easy ownership and zero penalty charges involved, the Zerolution is a hassle free way of owning a device. This isn\u2019t a leasing program as you do own the phone after 24 months. If you calculate the monthly payment over 24 months it is cheaper than buying the phone outright at full retail price. That\u2019s of course without the optional early upgrade (RM30/month) and device protection (RM15/month) add-on. For those that change phones on an annual basis, this can be seen as a leasing programme as you can swap phones easily without the hassle of trading in. Once you\u2019ve completed the full 24 months period, the phone is yours to keep.

In terms of price, surprisingly they are quite competitively priced at RM1,399 for the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual and RM1,599 for the Xperia M5. The 11street exclusive pre-orders will start shipping in early September.

Not only it gets a huge 6\u2033 Full HD display, it also features 13MP cameras for both front and back. To get the best out of your selfie shots, the front camera has a wider 22mm view and it gets a soft LED Selfie Flash for better illumination. With an ultra-thin bezel, the Xperia C5 Ultra looks almost bezel-less and the shorter width makes it easy to handle with a single hand.

Samsung might prove doubters wrong that every new generation, beckons the need for better performance; justifying the similar Exynos 7420 making a reappreance. Reusing the same processor as the old guard isn\u2019t a totally horrible idea, as it continues to top AnTuTu benchmarks with over 67,000 points.The Galaxy S6 edge\u2019s double edge display now gets a +, stretching the screen to phablet stardom at 5.7-inches. We might have a bigger screen but the other innards are all the same, except for a bigger battery. When the Galaxy S6 edge was first introduced, it came with a couple of features including a People\u2019s Edge which brings your 5 favourite contacts closer to you. With the S6 edge+, they have enhanced this further with Apps Edge which allows you to put 5 app shortcuts within a thumb\u2019s reach. In addition, the edge features are now accessible in any screen interface, instead of being limited to just the home screen.Even though internally it is very much the same but the introduction of the new Keyboard Cover accessory further enhances the typing experience on a large smart phone \u2013 giving it a more ergonomic feel that could possibly please die hard BlackBerry users.The Galaxy Note 5 is a similar device with the Galaxy S6 edge+, offering a 5.7\u2033 Quad HD display and a similar Exynos Octa-Core processor with 4GB of RAM.\u00a0The S-Pen is the key differentiation in the Galaxy Note series and already in its fifth generation, we\u2019ve seen a steady progression of innovation. From AirView during the beginning to an extension of features which includes Action Memo, Screen Write and increasing pressure sensitivity. The Note 5 promises to bring a stylus experience to another level \u2013 touting it to be a close second to writing on paper.Accompanying the S-Pen\u2019s housing silo which now has a push to eject mechanism will be the standard micro USB charging port. But if you\u2019re not into cables, you could make use of its built-in wireless charging properties of the device which is similar to the Galaxy S6. You\u2019ll get a 0% to 100% charge with the cable in 90 minutes with Adaptive Fast Charging, while wireless charging takes a little longer \u2013 120 minutes for a full charge.Optimisation of the TouchWiz will be influential in keeping the lights on the 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screened phablet that pushes a pixel density 518 ppi. That latest battery-friendly Exynos processor and 4GB RAM might help and hopefully won\u2019t stump the 3,000mAh battery too much as the older Note 4 survived quite well on a battery larger by 220mAh.Encased in metal and glass, the Note 5 will be thinner and among the lightest Note ever, weighing just 169g. For imaging we\u2019ll see a familiar 16-megapixel sensor on the back with Optical Image Stabilisation coupled with a 5-megapixel front camera.

{"text": "Nearly a year has gone since the  and flash-forward to the present with the arrival of the much anticipated  is a reality. Today we aim to pit the old against the new and discuss the main differences, mainly positive but some questionable.The mobile tech giant has made some brand-new features both in hardware and software. Mentioning the former first, the processor gets an upgrade from the Exynos 5433 (SM-N910C) / Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 (SM-N910S) to the chart-topping AnTuTu scorer, the Exynos 7420. Samsung\u2019s newest phablet also gets a 1GB bump in the RAM department compared to the Note 4 (3GB), adhering to the current industry standard for new flagships.Furthering connectivity speeds is the Note 5\u2019s latest LTE Cat 6/Cat 9 pushing the older Cat 4 enabled Note 4 out of the water, with blistering future-proof speeds once telecommunication infrastructure is done catching up. Moving to the camera, we\u2019ll see a similar 16-megapixel main camera, but the front shutter is now 5-megapixels from the previous 3.7-megapixels. Samsung has said to make the camera interface zippier as launching speeds have improved from 1.1 seconds to 0.6 seconds. Audio advancements are now up scaled to support an ultra-high-quality listening experience \u2013 couple that with Samsung Milk Music and you\u2019ll be set to enjoy yourself.The star of the show of course will be the spring loaded eject-able S-Pen that will no longer chip anymore finger nails. Samsung has promised that the feeling of writing will be as close as to writing on paper but hasn\u2019t mentioned raw specifications of increasing pressure sensitivity as for now. Hardware aside, it\u2019ll also be enhanced to Scroll Capture long screenshots with Screen Write: a sure favourite for long direction instructions and conversations. Air command will now always appear on-screen to assist you with your S-Pen functionality.Off-screen notes can be easily written with the S-Pen just by simply tapping on the screen with the stylus while in standby. PDF annotations are also easier with the S-Pen, giving users the means to simply sign a PDF document using the stylus and sending it off to be printed for your business needs.Design language also takes a turn with the latest iteration of the Note series. Gone are the days of plastically backs and in comes a more superior built product. Comparing the old and the new side by side and you\u2019ll be able to tell them distinctively apart, especially so when you take a look around the edges and rounded backing of the Note 5. Placement of the camera and audio speakers have been adjusted to make the device better to look at and change the listening experience a little. Making up the bottom is now the moved speaker, and audio jack, while the positions of the S-Pen and micro-USB port remain. The phablet is now lighter too, weighing in at 171g, opposed to 176g (Note 4) and comes in a smaller footprint \u2013 153.2 x 76.1 x 7.6mm compared to the slightly larger Note 4 (153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5mm)Samsung has addressed some qualms \u2013 mostly related to its stance on premium materials and removable batteries. Seeing a change of trend towards users who prefer a more luxurious feel, the Korean manufacturer has decided that it was time to exclude removable batteries in replacement of a metal encased design From the S6 series to the current Note 5, we\u2019re now seeing a more streamlined aesthetically pleasing device with more metal and glass. Although, there will always be trade-offs and this time it\u2019s no exception, as the glass will pick up finger prints and smudges quite easily. The battery also takes a hit, now only 3,000mAh battery housed in non-removable fashion due to the unibody design, which dips from the old Note 4 \u2013 3,220mAh.Worry not, as the Note 5 will be helped along by fast charging the device from 0% \u2013 100% takes 90 minutes, 9 minutes quicker than its predecessor. If cables is not your thing, you\u2019ll be happy as the newer Note even supports fast wireless charging, although charge times are nothing to shout about (0% \u2013 100% in 120 minutes). Other than the removable battery omission, we\u2019re also seeing an exodus of MicroSD support from the Note 5 \u2013 unsure why they decided to go down this route, seeing as dual-SIM trays usually are hybrids, allowing users to choose two SIMs or use one + a MicroSD card. Lastly, seemingly seen as an odd decision, Samsung decided to leave out the infared blaster seen on older released devices.To cap-off, the Note 5 has made refinements in these categories:and sacrificed some features in the process, as well:We\u2019ll see how the Note 5 fares when it goes on sale in selected regions, while it\u2019ll make an appearance sometime in September for our local market.[  ]", "id": "682"},

It gets 16GB of storage that\u2019s expandable with microSD, a 13MP main and a large 8MP front camera for higher resolution selfies.Keeping the lights on is a 2,320mAh capacity battery which supports VOOC Flash Charge and overall the R7 is only 6.3mm thick. Despite having an all metal build, the R7 is lighter than its ultra-slim  at just 147 grams. In terms of design, the OPPO R7 is identical to its R7 Lite and the only way to tell the difference is the display, since the Lite version pushes just HD 720p resolution. Another difference is the operating system where the OPPO R7 still runs on Android 4.4 KitKat. This is surprising since its R7 Lite and R7 Plus are already running on Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Nevertheless OPPO Malaysia promises that a Lollipop software update will be made available for the R7 soon. Like the rest of the family, the OPPO R7 series supports 4G LTE and Dual-SIMs, with the 2nd slot doing double duty as a microSD expansion if required. For those that pre-ordered the R7 Plus, it will be available starting this Friday, 14th August. If you\u2019re one of them, OPPO will be contacting you soon on collection details. For the R7 Lite, there\u2019s no firm availability details yet but OPPO Malaysia is targeting by end of August.", "id": "684"},

The Honor 7 will also come with a fingerprint scanner for biometric security functionality. 3GB of RAM gives the device ample memory to handle multitasking on the distinctive EMUI 3.1 overlay of Android 5.0 Lollipop.

Can Samsung maintain its phablet king status in its 5th generation?Here\u2019s the stuff we know about the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ and it\u2019s quite a mouthful.Practically everything has already been leaked but the weight of this information should always be taken with a grain of salt to ensure no disappointment. For the Note 5, we\u2019ve seen mock-ups, , benchmarks and even the ! Not short on building the hype for the actual device, which is assumed to carry either a 64-bit Exynos 7420 Octa-core processor or a better Exynos 7422 with an all-in-one chip solution. Screen size will stick to the 5.7-inch footprint and utilise its own Super AMOLED display technology with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 (Quad HD).Performance will be helped along with an ample amount of RAM at 4GB and internal storage will cap off at 32GB. Some will be put-off by omitting the microSD option but will take comfort in the S-pen being improved to auto-eject through a spring loaded mechanism. Some sources go on to say that the device will be as heavily skinned as previous iterations, as TouchWiz and S-pen apps will be taking the load from the 4GB, leaving probably about only half left to be used.Snapping photos will be made using a 16-megapixel rear shooter that takes advantage of OIS feature and the front will be a decent 5-megapixel sensor, similar to its current Galaxy S6. In terms of battery capacity, the Galaxy Note 5 is said to be having a 3,000mAh capacity battery that\u2019s non-removable. Just like the Galaxy S6, the battery is smaller than its predecessors but Samsung reckons that its frugal Exynos processor and Universal Flash Storage would sip less power.  Skimming only halfway through, we\u2019ve yet to mention the Galaxy S6 edge+. Design aesthetics will not be much to rave about for the S6 edge+ will retain the same design as the S6 edge, just a slight increase in its width and length (obviously being a 5.7-inch display). The processor is likely to be the same Exynos 7420 powerhouse but it gets 4GB of RAM just like the Note 5. The battery is expected to be similar with the Note 5, housing a 3,000mAh capacity unit that\u2019s embedded into its unibody form. The double edge display will also be  with more features so you can use it for more than just contacting your 5 favourite contacts.

While there\u2019s no microSD expansion slots, there are those who are hoping that Samsung might allow you to pop-in a microSD card onto the 2nd SIM slot just like its current .Though all this information has come out, we\u2019ve yet to hear anything about the price range of the two devices. Based on past launch prices of these devices, we\u2019ll attempt to speculate the range of Samsung\u2019s newest additions:Looking at how Samsung priced their previous models and considering GST has kicked in, we reckon that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM 2,699, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovers above the RM 3,100 mark. Definitely they are not going to be cheap but it is still more affordable than the iPhone 6 Plus that\u2019s priced at RM3,126 for its base 16GB model. With 2 new flagship phones, we expect Samsung to slash prices of its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge by about RM200-300 and this is  worldwide.

To make it stand out from the current Zenfone 2, it gets an extra Laser AF feature, hence the \u201cLaser\u201d moniker. This allows the camera to focus onto subjects as quick as 0.3 seconds especially under low light.

The front gets a 7\u2033 IPS display that does a modest 1024\u00d7600 pixels resolution and it runs on Intel\u2019s new Atom x3-C3230 Quad-Core processor.

The ZenPad C 7.0 is quite light at 265 grams and has a thickness of 8.4mm. At time of release, it runs on a newer Android 5.0 Lollipop along with its custom ZenUI.

Out of the box, it still runs on Android 4.4 KitKat with its own ZenUI running on top. For RM399, the ASUS Zenfone 2 enhanced version cheaper than the  and  version. However it is a step back in the display department and if you can afford a little more, you could get a smart phone with a HD 720p display and with 4G support like the Redmi 2.

As shown above, it will be their MIUI 7, their latest iteration of its custom ROM. It has been a year since MIUI 6 was  with a clean and flat interface, which looks heavily inspired by .The current MIUI 6 was originally based on Android 4.4 KitKat and most recently it supports Android 5.0 Lollipop on their new  smart phone. While it is Lollipop underneath, it doesn\u2019t feature any of the Material Design elements that came as standard on most devices. Looking at the \u201c7\u201d teaser, Xiaomi might just incorporate some of the flat Material Design appearance this time around and it will be likely based on the current Android 5.1.1. With  expected to go live by end of this year, Xiaomi seriously needs to look beyond just Lollipop. In terms of availability, their current flagships like the Mi Note and Mi 4i could be among the first to get it before it trickles down to the rest of its Redmi family.Will Xiaomi announce a new device? It might be possible but we are not expecting a Mi 5 flagship anytime soon, at least for this quarter.   [ ,  ]", "id": "720"},
{"text": "Samsung Malaysia will be refreshing its flagship tablet line up with the . Announced  last month, the Galaxy Tab S2 is their thinnest and lightest tablet yet at 5.6mm and it weighs from just 265g (Tab S2 8.0 WiFi). The local tech media will be invited for a preview this week but retailer SenHeng has published its retail price along with its bundled freebies.The Galaxy Tab S2 comes in 2 sizes \u2013 a compact 8.0 incher and a full size 9.7\u2033 version, both of which are now having a 4:3 display aspect ratio, that\u2019s similar to the iPad. For the Malaysian market, we are getting only the 4G LTE versions. Compared to the previous Galaxy Tab S, the new version gets a dip in display with a Retina Display-like 2048\u00d71536 pixels resolution, instead of a Quad HD 2560\u00d71600 resolution. Under the hood, it gets an Exynos 5433 Octa-Core (Quad 1.9GHz + Quad 1.3GHz) processor mated to 3GB of RAM, which is the same powerhouse as the Galaxy Note 4. In terms of storage, we are getting 32GB on board which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB. Don\u2019t expect anything fancy with the camera as it gets a 8MP main unit and a front facing 2.1MP shooter. Out of the box, it runs on a more current Android 5.0 Lollipop and keeping the lights on is a 4,000mAh capacity battery for the 8 inch version, while the bigger 9.7\u2033 tablet gets a 5,870mAh capacity unit. In terms of price, it is quite similar with the previous version with the Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 going for RM1,699, while the Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 is priced at RM1,999.

{"text": "With  and  smart phones face extinction, most smart phones are using the standard candy-bar form factor with a huge screen in front. There are couple of Chinese brands that tried to do something different like the / series with a rotatable camera and a rather odd  that has a flip out camera lens.Huawei is up to something as well and a new Honor device has been spotted on China\u2019s TENAA database with a rather interesting camera design. Both front and rear cameras are placed onto a sliding module which can be popped-up when required. A large physical button is spotted at the sides, which could be used to spring the camera into action. The rear camera is always visible no matter what position its on but the front camera remains hidden until the slider is popped out. While it looks out of the norm, we simply don\u2019t see any benefits of such approach considering the lens are still having a fixed position. At least on the OPPO N3, the rotating camera module is motorised, allowing you to take a hassle free panorama shots in either vertical or horizontal. Perhaps the front of the smart phone looks cleaner this way but seriously nobody is complaining if there\u2019s a selfie camera placed upfront. There\u2019s no word on its full specs and if this aims to be a super camera phone, they should put more emphasis on its camera sensor, optics and its UI. Do you see any real benefits of a slider camera lens?[ ,  ]", "id": "722"}
